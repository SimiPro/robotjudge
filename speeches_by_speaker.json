Mr. Speaker, today I honor and remember one of \nPennsylvania's sons, and a native of Philadelphia, United States Coast \nGuard Signalman Third Class Joseph Gerczak.\n  Working as an apprentice machinist making gun parts after graduating \nhigh school, Joseph enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard on September 26, \n1942.\n  Following his training and early assignments, Joseph joined the crew \nof Landing Ship Tank 66, and was on board during the first assault \nagainst the Japanese-held Borgen Bay Area of New Britain on December \n26, 1943.\n  Joseph's ship was in the bay while other vessels unloaded cargo onto \nthe beach when seven Japanese dive bombers attacked his ship. He \nimmediately manned his battle station and was the first crew member to \nreturn fire against the enemy.\n  Joseph opened fire, unloading his drums of ammunition into the dive \nbombers, blasting two from the sky while bombs fell from the planes, \nstriking his ship. He continued his assault against the enemy planes \nuntil he was struck by a blast that fatally wounded him and destroyed \nhis battle station.\n  The American assault at Borgen Bay was successful, due in part to \nJoseph's courage, perseverance, and unwavering strength in the face of \ntremendous odds. Joseph was recognized for his sacrifice, posthumously \nawarded the Silver Star, Purple Heart, and the Presidential Unit \nCommendation.\n  This weekend, on March 9th, 2018, the Coast Guard will commission a \nFast Response Cutter in Honolulu, Hawaii. The cutter will be named \nUSCGC Joseph Gerczak. Joseph's sister and only surviving sibling, 92-\nyear-old Stella Gerczak, will be in attendance at the ship's \ncommissioning. Stella lives in my community, and we owe her, Joseph, \nand their entire family a debt of gratitude we will never be able to \nfully repay.\n  The commissioning of the USCGC Joseph Gerczak is just one way we can \nshow our heartfelt and lasting gratitude for a brave young man who gave \nhis life in service to our great nation.\n"], "Ms. SLAUGHTER": ["2018-01-18", "  Ms. SLAUGHTER.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Mitchell and \nCongresswoman Mimi Walters for arranging this Special Order to \nhighlight the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I am excited to be \njoined by our Texas colleagues.\n  Texas is a big winner, like many States, because of the Tax Cuts and \nJobs Act. They estimate it will create 81,000 new, good-paying jobs in \nour State alone. But that is not just our State. You see huge job gains \nin California, New York, throughout the Southern States, throughout our \nMidwest area, and throughout our manufacturing regions.\n  This historic tax reform is making a real difference for our families \nand our workers. We all know about tax relief for our small businesses, \nthe first ever 20 percent small business deduction in history. The bill \nwill be a write-off on day one in new investment in plants, equipment, \nsoftware, and technology.\n  People know that we made our companies more competitive so they can \ncompete and win all around the world, especially here at home.\n  I get excited about what we did for families, lowering the tax rates \nat every level. So whether you made $20,000 or $520,000, you keep more \nof what you earn. We doubled the standard deduction so few people have \nto itemize. We doubled the child credit and quadrupled how many \nAmericans can actually use it. For the first time, all middle class \nAmericans are going to get help raising children. We are doing away \nwith the AMT except for households up to $1 million. What that means \nnext year is, instead of 5 million Americans getting caught up with \nthat double tax, it is about 200,000, a fraction of what it is today.\n\n  What I really love are the stories. I was in Home Depot the other \nday, on Sunday. Apparently, we are redoing our bathroom. So my wife was \nlooking at samples, and a woman came up and introduced herself. Her \nname is Pam. She is a small-business person. She redoes furniture, \nrepaints, and all that, but she works at Home Depot to make ends meet. \nShe introduced herself and said:\n\n       Thank you. I get $184 more every paycheck. Maybe that \n     couple thousand dollars doesn't mean much in Washington, but \n     for my family, it really means a lot. Thank you for that.\n\n  Donald from Willis, Texas, saw the benefits of this law in his pay \nstub. He said:\n\n       My Federal tax deducted from my paycheck went from 12 to 9 \n     percent. Yes, I am very happy.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, because of tax reform, Texans are excited for a strong \nand growing economy.\n  Larry from Spring, Texas, said:\n\n       As a 78-year-old retiree working part time, even a small \n     difference in take-home pay is\n\n\n     welcome. I am delighted to see the spur to overall economic \n     activity that should benefit all, locally and nationally.\n\n\n  Every day, I hear stories like this: people receiving raises and \nbigger benefits at work. And we did, simply, the Code. As Congressman \nMitchell pointed out, under the new Tax Code, next year, nearly 90 \npercent of Americans will be able to file their taxes using a simple \npostcard-style system. That is fairness. That is growth. That is \nincreasing jobs and paychecks.\n  I want to thank my colleagues from Texas joining us here tonight for \ntheir critical role in passing this historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \nWithout this support, it wouldn't have happened.\n  I also thank Congressman Mitchell and Congresswoman Walters for \narranging this Special Order and continuing, as they did during the \ndebates, informing people of the tax reform plan.

Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise, on behalf of \nCongressman Bobby Scott and myself, to recognize the achievements of \nRon Carson who has made the plight of tens of thousands of disabled \ncoal miners a central part of his life's work. Through his decades of \nwork directing three black lung clinics in Southwest Virginia, and \ntireless advocacy efforts across the coal fields of this country, he \noffered help and hope to miners whose lungs were irreversibly scarred \nwith the scourge of black lung disease.\n  Ron was born in Pennington Gap, Virginia during segregation. He \nattended a one-room primary school on land that his great-great-\ngrandmother, Rachael Scott, had donated in 1939 for education of black \nchildren in Lee County. Ron and his wife Jill, a Member of the Town \nCouncil in Pennington Gap, founded the Appalachian African American \nCultural Center in that same brick school house, which now preserves \nthe life stories, history, heritage, culture and events of African \nAmericans in Southwest Virginia. Although segregated in housing and \nschools, African Americans found a measure of inclusion in Central \nAppalachia, where they were able to work free from the harsh conditions \nin the Deep South, ad many received equal pay for their work mining \ncoal.\n  Ron worked for Westmoreland Coal Co. in Appalachia, Virginia as did \nhis stepfather. His grandfather and great-grandfather both worked for \nmany years for Blue Diamond Coal in Bonny Blue, Virginia. Ron later \nattended the Massachusetts School of Pharmacy, and in 1990 returned as \nan outreach worker in the black lung clinic operating out of the St. \nCharles Community Health Clinic. For the past 20 years he has served as \nthe director of three black lung clinics which are now part of Stone \nMountain Health Services. In addition to helping miners secure \ndiagnostic tests, treatment and benefits counseling, Ron led an effort \nto develop what is now the largest program for non-lawyers to \nsuccessfully advocate for black lung benefits before the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor.\n  There are very few attorneys who represent miners filing claims for \nblack lung benefits. And, coal miners proceedings pro se are no match \nfor the expert legal and medical resources that coal companies and \ninsurers dedicate to each case. Ron and his team have worked to fill \nthis void by providing training for clinics, doctors, lawyers and lay \nrepresentatives in all 15 coal producing states. The lay advocates \nworking for the Stone Mountain clinics have helped miners win over \n2,000 black lung claims in the past 17 years.\n  In recent years, Ron documented how miners with progressive massive \nfibrosis (PMF), the most advanced form of black lung disease, have \nflooded the clinics in southwestern Virginia. Working with the National \nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), he recently co-\nauthored an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association \nwhich verified an epidemic of this lethal form of the disease in \nCentral Appalachia and helped to elevate national awareness. ``Mining \ndisasters get monuments, meanwhile black lung deaths get tombstones. \nAnd I've seen many a tombstone in the last 28 years from black lung,'' \nhe noted.\n  At a roundtable Ron organized in Wise, Virginia, disabled miners, \nphysicians and lawyers explained how the current black lung \nadjudication process keeps justice out of teach for fat too many \ndeserving miners and survivors.\n  Ron Carson has been accessible to Members of Congress and provided \nwise counsel, as well as compassionate and enduring service to his \ncommunity. He has been recognized by the United Mine Workers of America \n(UMWA) and his peers in the black lung community. On behalf of out \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives, Congressman Scott and I \nextend out appreciation for Ron's service to those in need.\n"], "Mr. COHEN": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the DUI Reporting \nAct, a bill I introduced today with my colleague Steve Chabot\n\n\nalong with the support of Mothers Against Drunk Driving and a \nbipartisan coalition of Representatives from across the United States.\n  If enacted, it would address the loophole in our nation's drunken-\ndriving laws that enables repeat DUI offenders to be charged and tried; \nas first-time offenders because of inconsistent reporting.\n  Currently, when police make a drunk driving arrest, they don't always \nhave access to information about all of the driver's previous arrests \nfor driving under the influence.\n  The reason is because not all police report DUI arrests to either the \nNational Crime Information Center, or ``NCIC'' for short, or the Next \nGeneration Identification database, or ``NGI,'' which are the national \ncrime databases that can be made instantly available to police right \nfrom their patrol cars.\n  The consequences of this lack of reporting can prove tragic. Just a \nfew years ago there was a terrible accident in northern Mississippi, \njust outside of my Congressional District. Two teenagers from Memphis \nwere killed when the car they were driving was struck by a drunk driver \nwho had accrued seven DUI charges since 2008 and had been allowed to \nplead guilty five times to a first-offense DUI.\n  When the law enforcement officer ran the suspect's driving record in \nthe national database, his past DUI convictions never showed up.\n  This is shameful. A DUI somewhere should be recognized as a DUI \nanywhere. It should not matter where you were caught driving drunk. If \nyou drive drunk, previous offenses should be recorded and penalties \nshould increase so innocent lives can be saved.\n  The accrual of multiple first-time DUI offenses is unconscionable and \nmust be brought to an end.\n  Our bill will save lives by enacting common-sense, bipartisan reforms \nto harmonize reporting standards for DUI offenses across the states.\n  I urge my colleagues to help pass it quickly.\n"], "Ms. JAYAPAL": ["2018-03-07", "  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Raskin for his \nleadership on the Progressive Caucus and for his leadership on the \nJudiciary Committee. Nobody understands the Constitution better than a \nconstitutional law professor.\n  I appreciate you bringing the reality of the situation to us. Nobody \nis talking about trying to take guns away from everybody. We are \ntalking about making sure that we have safety with anybody who owns a \ngun and that we have the ability to check any of the dangerous contexts \nfor which guns can be used. We have a responsibility, really, to \nprotect our country, to protect our young people, and to do something \nfor all of the families that have been affected by gun violence.\n  In addition to all of the things that he mentioned, we need to \nconsider gun violence as a public health crisis. That is what it is. \nAnd when we look around at the millions of people who are dying from \ngun violence, you think about this, and you think about the way in \nwhich we treated vehicle fatalities as a public health crisis and we \ninstituted laws around seatbelts, and the way we thought about smoking \nas a public health crisis and we instituted laws around smoking. But, \nin order to do that, we had to first do research into those areas and \nfigure out what were the best ways for us to move forward as a country \nin preventing those kinds of fatalities that are preventable.\n  Unfortunately, what happened in this country is that Congressman \nDickey, some time ago, passed an amendment called the Dickey amendment. \nWhile it didn't explicitly prohibit research into gun violence, it all \nbut did that.\n  There have now been many, many calls to repeal the Dickey amendment. \nInterestingly, Congressman Dickey passed away last year, last April. \nBefore he died, in 2012, he actually came out on the record and said \nthat he wished he hadn't been so reactionary, that he wished he hadn't \npassed that amendment, because he realized that it did lead to a \nchilling effect on research into gun safety. The way that it did that \nis, when they passed the amendment, it essentially said that no Federal \nfunds should be used for advocacy, but, at the same time, the amount of \nfunds that were used for research were cut by exactly that amount.\n  So this is not about advocacy; this is about how do we protect our \ncountry, how do we treat this as what it is: a public health crisis.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am here to say that I am really proud of my home State \nof Washington. Just yesterday, we became the latest State to ban bump \nstocks. And we also had a senate committee pass a bill to mandate that \npeople purchasing rifles go through the same background checks required \nfor pistol purchases and that we increase the legal age to buy rifles \nto 21.\n  So, in less than a month, my home State has finally advanced \nmeaningful proposals to prevent gun violence. I wish I could say that \nwe were doing that here in Congress. I truly believe that there are \nMembers on both sides of the aisle who would like to pass sensible gun \nsafety regulations and legislation.\n  Unfortunately, I feel like we are being held hostage not by the \nreasons that we all came to Congress to get sensible things done that \nprotect our constituencies, but by lobbying interests in the National \nRifle Association; and every time there is a small movement towards \nprogress, somehow they come in and, essentially, squash those efforts.\n  In October of last year, Congress stood by after 58 people were \nkilled and over 500 injured at a music festival in Las Vegas. One of my \nconstituent's, Zach Elmore, sister was shot. Luckily, she was one of \nthe lucky ones who survived the shooting.\n  I read a letter on the floor that Zach had read to me--it was an \nincredibly moving letter--about his deep anger and frustration at \nCongress for not protecting his sister and millions like her, those who \nwere not as lucky as she was.\n  In November, Congress failed to act, after 26 people were killed and \n20 injured at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas; and then a few \nweeks ago, on Valentine's Day, as we all know, 14 students and 3 \nteachers were killed, and 15 injured, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High \nSchool in Florida.\n  Already, in 2018 alone, there have been 2,581 deaths because of gun \nviolence, including those precious lives that were lost at Parkland; \n105 of those deaths were children ages 11 and under.\n  Let me just say that one more time: 105 of the 2,581 deaths, this \nyear alone, were children ages 11 and under.\n  As Members of Congress, we need to make sure our kids are safe.\n  I am so grateful to the energy and the commitment and the passion and \nthe smarts and the organizing strength of the Parkland students, \nbecause, as you say, they were not first graders who couldn't organize \nfor themselves. They are students who are soon going to be voters. And \nthey understand that they can't vote right now, but they also \nunderstand that they do have a voice, their parents' vote, and they can \nmake sure that people across the country understand that we have a \nresponsibility to them, to our children, to the people across the \ncountry who are afraid of sending their kids to school.\n  That should be our number one priority is keeping our kids safe. Our \nkids should be able to walk into schools knowing that they can fully \nfocus on learning. Our parents shouldn't have to wonder whether their \nkids will come home from school.\n  My heart goes out to the families that lost someone in the Parkland \nshooting and all of the shootings across the country. I am proud to \nstand alongside incredible young people who wasted no time to demand \naction and justice for their friends and teachers. They are determined, \nthey are brave, they are unafraid, and they are depending on us to pass \nmeaningful legislation to end gun violence.\n  One of the interesting things that I heard them say when I met with \nthem is: We are not looking for the whole package. We just want to see \nsteps along the way that show us that it is possible for us, on a \nbipartisan basis, to make some progress on this critical issue, to make \nsure that no child, no parent, no community, ever again, has to \nexperience the unspeakable tragedy of another school shooting.\n  I am tired of seeing men, women, and children die because the gun \nlobby puts profit over people. That is not, as Mr. Raskin so eloquently \nsaid, what our Founders intended by the right to bear arms. Support for \nstricter measures to prevent gun violence is at an all-time\n\n\nhigh, on a bipartisan basis. Eighty-seven percent of gun owners and 74 \npercent of NRA members support commonsense solutions like criminal \nbackground checks.\n  I have a plea for gun owners across the country. My husband used to \nbe a hunter. We had guns at home. And I understand the need for people \nto have guns for recreational purposes, to ensure their own safety. But \nthis is not about that. It is not about taking guns away from people, \nwho legitimately exercise responsible behavior. It is about making sure \nthat we have the protections in place so that no more children, no more \npeople die.\n\n\n  So here is my plea for gun owners: urge the NRA to represent your \nviews, show them that you mean business, maybe even consider \nterminating your NRA membership if the organization continues to \nadvocate against these kinds of sensible gun reforms.\n  Here in Congress, I hope that we act now. I really truly believe--and \nI have talked to some of my Republican colleagues who also want to do \nsomething about this. They don't want to be hamstrung. They want to \nmove legislation forward, but not by attaching legislation that \nactually loosens gun restrictions into legislation that helps us.\n  We need just one or two pieces of commonsense gun reform legislation \nso that we can show these young people that we are responding to their \npleas: no more shootings in schools, no more shootings in places of \nworship, no more shootings in our streets, no more mass shootings, \nperiod.\n  Let's show these students and students at schools across the country \nthat we are not afraid to protect them. Let's show them that we can \nchoose our country over the gun lobby. Let's stand with our kids. Let's \npass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I join Mr. Raskin in hoping that in the Judiciary \nCommittee, which is the committee of record for this issue, that we can \nat least have some hearings on this.\n  What is so problematic about having a hearing on public health \nresearch into gun violence? What is so problematic about having a \nhearing on multiple pieces of legislation that have bipartisan support? \nIsn't that what we are supposed to do? I know that is why I came here.\n  I am a first term Member, and I know our speaker is as well, and I \nbelieve that we have much more in common than we do that divides us.\n  We don't have to necessarily tackle every piece of this, but let's \nmake some substantial progress forward together, and let's show our \nstudents that we will protect them.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman again for his leadership."], "Mr. ROGERS of Alabama": ["2018-03-07", "  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama.

The EPA's first attempt at a rule was vacated, but \nnot before the industry spent millions in compliance measures that were \nultimately found to be invalid.\n  Small brick and ceramics businesses have been the hardest hit by the \nfirst rule; and if something isn't done, many of these small businesses \nwill be forced to close their doors for good.\n  H.R. 1917 would provide much-needed regulatory relief to brick and \nceramics businesses by simply stating that we need to let the judicial \nreview process move ahead before we penalize hardworking people.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and to support \nbusinesses all across the country."], "Mr. FLORES": ["2018-03-07", "  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4986, RAY \nBAUM'S Act, to reauthorize the FCC. I am particularly pleased to see \nthat we are addressing potential problems imposed upon our nation's \nradio broadcasters as a result of the 2012 spectrum repack.\n  That auction has been a tremendous catalyst for broadband deployment, \nbut it created\n\n\nunintended consequences. Many radio stations that are co-located on TV \ntowers could be forced to shut down during spectrum relocation. With \n670 radio stations possibly being impacted, we must ensure our local \nradio stations are protected in a process from which they will receive \nno benefit.\n  I appreciate the inclusion of section 603, which makes funds \navailable for radio broadcasters to address this problem. This section \nincorporates the fundamentals of the bill that Representative Gene \nGreen and I introduced in H.R. 3685, the Radio Consumer Protection Act. \nOur bipartisan bill established a radio protection fund to reimburse \nimpacted stations for their costs incurred as a result of the repack.\n  I am also appreciative of the addition of FM translators in section \n603. Many FM and AM stations rely on these translators to provide \nservice in rural and remote areas across America. Passage of H.R. 4986, \nensures that the spectrum repack fund will include FM translators.\n  In closing, I think it is fitting that H.R. 4986 is named the ``RAY \nBAUM'S Act'' in honor of the former staff director of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee, Ray Baum. Ray dedicated his life to serving the \npeople of Oregon and the people of this country. It has been more than \n25 years since Congress last reauthorized the FCC and I can think of no \nbetter way to honor Ray.\n  I urge support for H.R. 4986.\n"], "Mr. GIANFORTE": ["2018-01-18", "  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the critical \nwork of UDAP Industries, a company in Butte, Montana, that produces \nself-defense sprays. It was founded by Mark Matheny, a survivor of a \ngrizzly bear attack.\n  When you are in bear country, bear spray is critically important. \nCiting concerns about the ozone layer, the EPA moved, in 2015, to ban \nthe propellant used to make bear spray shoot out of the canister. EPA \nsuggested a replacement that was half as effective, undermining safety. \nRather than give in and make a less effective, inferior product, UDAP \nand others petitioned the EPA to reconsider.\n  After my office and others worked with the EPA to waive the ban for \nbear spray, EPA did the right thing and waived the ban that would have \ncreated a safety hazard. I will continue working with UDAP and others \nto ensure that they are not burdened by unnecessary Federal \nregulations.\n"], "Ms. LEE": ["2018-02-26", "  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Evans for his \ntremendous leadership and his friendship, and I thank him for hosting \nthis very important Special Order hour. His leadership in our caucus to \nfight the epidemic of gun violence in America is bold, it is visionary, \nand I thank him for calling us together tonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me also just acknowledge my sister and colleague \nCongresswoman Robin Kelly, who spoke earlier. Congresswoman Kelly \nchairs our Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, and she \ncontinues to demand that gun violence be treated as the public health \ncrisis that it is.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues in the Congressional \nBlack Caucus to say enough is enough. The epidemic of gun violence in \nAmerica must be brought to an end.\n  Two weeks ago, the world stood in shock as yet another gunman \nmassacred innocent students and teachers in an American school. The 19-\nyear-old killer legally purchased an AR-15 assault rifle and killed 17 \nstudents at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n  My heart goes out to the victims, their classmates, families, and the \nentire Parkland community. We must take action so that this never \nhappens again. Newtown, Aurora, Charleston, Orlando, Las Vegas, and now \nParkland, this is not normal in a civilized society.\n  The United States of America is the only developed nation that \nexperiences mass shootings with this level of frequency. This doesn't \nhappen anywhere else in the world. Of course, we know it is because the \nNational Rifle Association can't buy their votes in other countries, \nand the children's lives come first.\n  Speaker Ryan and the Republicans in Congress have been bought by the \nNational Rifle Association, making it easier for mass shootings to \noccur.\n  Let me just say that mass shootings in public schools, unfortunately, \nare just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to gun violence in \nAmerica. Our communities, especially our urban communities, are war \nzones.\n  On an average day, 93 innocent lives in America are cut short due to \ngun violence. This year alone, there have been over 8,200 incidents of \ngun violence in America, including 24 mass shootings. These senseless \nacts of violence have taken more than 2,200 lives already.\n  I represent the 13th Congressional District of California in the bay \narea, which includes the city of Oakland, which has been brutalized by \ngun violence. Since 2014, 312 of my constituents have had their lives \ncut short by gun violence. Our community feels their loss every single \nday. Here are just a few of their names and tragic stories.\n  Davon Ellis: Davon was a star football player and an excellent \nstudent at Oakland Tech High School. He was shot and killed while \nwalking home from school. My nephew was walking with him when he was \ngunned down.\n  Travon Godfrey: Travon was killed in 2016 while sitting in a car with \nhis friends in front of his home. Every time I think about Travon, my \nheart breaks. Travon came to a town meeting that I held on gun violence \nin January of 2016.\n  He was worried about coming to that town meeting, and he shared the \ntoll that gun violence had taken on his life and that of his friends' \nlives, yet he was determined to make a difference and finish school and \ngo on to college. Less than a year later, on November 28 in 2016, \nTravon and his lifelong friend, Deante Miller, were shot and killed in \nbroad daylight.\n  Anibal Andres Ramirez: Anibal was Oakland's youngest gun victim in \n2017. He was only 13 years old and was shot outside of a community \ncenter.\n\n\n  Francisca Martinez Ramirez: She was one of Oakland's first homicide \nvictims in 2018, killed by her husband during a domestic dispute.\n  Sadly, these heartbreaking stories are all too familiar in \ncommunities across the country. More than 30,000 Americans lose their \nlives to gun violence each year. Shootings now kill as many Americans \nas car accidents.\n  Last year, there were 77 gun violence homicides in my home city of \nOakland.\n\n\n  Already this year there have been 12. This is only February, Mr. \nSpeaker. How much bloodshed will we see this year?\n  We need action and we need it now. We need to pass, of course, the \nbipartisan King-Thompson legislation that strengthens background checks \nand keeps guns out of the wrong hands. And, yes, we need to reinstitute \na ban on assault weapons to get these weapons of war out of our \ncommunities. We need to close the gun show loophole once and for all.\n  Passing our assistant leader Congressman Clyburn's legislation to \nclose the 3-day loophole to require background checks to be completed \nbefore you can buy a gun, that legislation is long overdue. That is \ncommon sense.\n  At some point we have to stand up and say enough is enough and stand \nup to this NRA. Ninety-seven percent of Americans support some kind of \ngun violence prevention legislation.\n  So that is why I am standing here tonight with my colleagues from the \nCBC demanding that the Speaker take action and bring commonsense gun \nlegislation to the floor for a vote.\n  Give us a vote, Speaker Ryan, give us a vote."], "Mr. HIGGINS": ["2017-11-30", "  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, the President said yesterday that these \nmassive tax cuts for corporate America will be rocket fuel for the \neconomy--rocket fuel for corporate America and for the Trump empire for \ncertain, and a rocket-fueled hit to the heart of middle America for \nsure.\n  If you are in college and you are trying to become better and self-\nsufficient to thrive in the global economy, you are getting a big tax \nhike. If you have a medical illness that you were born into and your \ncosts exceed your insurance coverage, you will be getting a big tax \nhike. If you are 1 of 13 million Americans to lose your healthcare \ncoverage and the millions more who will see their premiums explode \nbecause congressional Republicans needed another $300 billion for their \ndeficit-exploding corporate tax cuts, you will be taking a big hit on \ntop of a big tax hike.\n  Mr. Speaker, this tax cut bill is a massive takeaway from middle \nAmerica and a massive giveaway to corporate America. The deficit will \nrise by $1.5 trillion, and both the Congressional Budget Office and the \nJoint Committee on Taxation confirmed that, in less than 10 years, \nAmericans making between $40,000 and $50,000 will pay $5.3 billion more \nin taxes.\n"], "Mr. HULTGREN": ["2018-01-18", "  Mr. HULTGREN.

I appreciate his work on this and for calling \nthis Special Order together tonight.\n  Once again, it is the time of year where I have the somber privilege \nto come to the floor and extend happy birthday wishes to Chinese human \nrights defender and prisoner of conscience, Zhu Yufu.\n  What should be an occasion for celebration remains marred by the fact \nthat, on February 13, Zhu Yufu will spend his 65th birthday in a \nChinese prison. This will mark his seventh consecutive birthday behind \nbars, another birthday separated from his family and children.\n  Although isolated, Zhu is certainly not forgotten. He has been a \nfervent champion for human rights in China for decades. He gives voice \nto a very fundamental and foundational principle: all people everywhere \nshould have the basic freedom to determine the course of their lives \nand express themselves according to their convictions without fear of \ngovernment repression. For living out that conviction, he languishes in \na Chinese prison in poor health and with irregular access to medical \ncare.\n  Stifling voices like Zhu's does not silence their cry nor weaken \ntheir cause. On the contrary, it shines a light on their plight and \nrenews and strengthens the effort to end repression and injustice in \nChina, as well as in other places around the world.\n  As long as Zhu Yufu remains incarcerated, I will continue to call \nupon the Chinese Government to provide him with sufficient food, care, \nand medical attention, and I will continue to call on the Chinese \nGovernment to release Zhu Yufu from prison.\n  In honor of Zhu Yufu, I would like to read a short poem that he \nwrote, and it was this poem that led to his arrest and imprisonment. I \nquote from his poem:\n\n     It's time, people of China! It's time. The Square belongs to \n           everyone. With your own two feet, it's time to head to \n           the Square and make your choice. It's time, people of \n           China! It's time.\n     A song belongs to everyone. From your own throat. It's time \n           to voice the song in your heart. It's time, people of \n           China! It's time. China belongs to everyone. Of your \n           own will, it's time to choose what China shall be.\n\n  Zhu, you are not forgotten.

Mr. Speaker, as we in Congress are faced with another \ncontinuing resolution, I cannot help but think about the wasted lives \nand money in Afghanistan.\n  On Sunday night's 60 Minutes, I watched, with great interest, a \nsegment about the 16-year war in Afghanistan. The title was: ``Kabul \nunder siege while America's longest war rages on.''\n  During the interview, Correspondent Lara Logan detailed the growing \ndanger in Afghanistan and interviewed General John Nicholson, commander \nof American forces in Afghanistan, as well as Afghanistan's President \nGhani. While I do not have the time to go into detail, this segment \nmade it very clear--and I think anyone watching would agree--that \nAfghanistan continues to be a failed policy.\n\n\n  At one time, Lara Logan stated to Nicholson: ``A lot of people at \nhome just don't buy that terrorists are coming from Afghanistan to \nattack them at home. They are worrying about the guy going to rent a \ntruck from Home Depot and drive into a crowd of civilians.''\n  In General Nicholson's response, there was a sentence that caught my \nattention, where he said: ``We need to defeat the ideology.''\n  I was amazed and astonished by his response. It has been said that \nyou cannot kill an ideology with a bullet or a bomb. So why are we \nstill trying?\n  This is why I am calling on Speaker Ryan, once again, to permit the \nHouse of Representatives to have a policy debate on Afghanistan.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have beside me a poster of a young woman whose husband \nwas killed in Afghanistan. It is so pathetic because the woman and the \nmother of the little girl sitting in her lap is crying, yet the little \ngirl is looking at the Army officer with a look like: Why am I here? \nWhy is there a flag-draped coffin? Why is my mother crying?\n  The little girl is too young to really understand what is happening.\n  Mr. Speaker, I call on Speaker Ryan to let us have a debate on the \npolicy issue of Afghanistan and its future.\n  I will close with the words of the 31st Commandant of the Marine \nCorps, General Chuck Krulak, who said: ``No one has ever conquered \nAfghanistan, and many have tried. We will join the list of nations that \ntried and failed.''\n  Mr. Ryan, the Speaker of the House, it is your time to call for this \nHouse to debate the future of Afghanistan.

Mr. President, as an outsider to this process, one of the \nfirst realizations was that, as I got here, things don't always move in \na linear fashion from point A to point B. Many times, the people who \nare trying to move an issue from point A to point B aren't interested \nin getting to point B.\n  I would like to talk tonight about one of those issues. I think we \nhave a situation here where both sides in this body--and I dare say in \nthe House--pretty much want the same thing, but\n\n\nI am afraid politics have gotten involved to where we are focusing more \non the differences of what we might hope for than on what we agree \nupon. That is a shame because not only do we put a great confusion on \nthese issues that I will talk about tonight, but we lose the confidence \nof the American people that we can even govern up here.\n  Last year, this President wanted to focus on getting the economy \ngoing. He wanted to focus on energy. He wanted to focus on regulations. \nHe wanted to focus on taxes. Check the boxes. We did that. I believe we \nare seeing some of the early manifestations of that in the economy now, \nwhere 123 businesses just announced at the end of the year, year-end \nbonuses related to this tax bill that we passed last year. That is an \nexample of where we can get together and make things happen.\n  I was in the Chair last night presiding over an hour and listening to \nconversations about a topic that I believe is very critical to where we \nare today. I heard several descriptions of a DACA bill but a bill no \none has seen yet. It hasn't been presented. This is merely 1 day before \nwe have to fund the government--before midnight tomorrow night.\n  In my opinion, I think most people in America believe it is \nirresponsible that Members of this body are threatening to shut down \nthe Federal Government over this DACA issue.\n  Members of the other side of the aisle used to agree with that \nposition. In 2013, the current minority leader said--and other people \ntalked about this today: ``We could say, `we're shutting down the \ngovernment . . . until you pass immigration reform.' It would be \ngovernmental chaos.''\n  Well, that is what we are facing tonight. I just don't think there is \nany need for it because, honestly, if you want to solve the DACA \nsituation, there is a deal to be done, but serious negotiations aren't \nbeing made right now because one side wants to create this issue and \nthreaten to shut down the government, thinking they can get both, a \nfinancing deal that they favor, along with this DACA proposition. That \nis unfortunate.\n  Our men and women in uniform deserve better than that. You are an ex-\nofficer. You know what I am saying. It is absolutely ridiculous that we \nare in the fourth month of this fiscal year in the middle of January--\nour fiscal year started October 1. It is absolutely ridiculous that we \nare sitting here today having not funded the government permanently for \nthe balance of this year. No other entity that I know of anywhere--any \nbusiness or any facet of operation--can do that except the U.S. Federal \nGovernment.\n  These two issues we are talking about have nothing to do with it and \nshould not be tied together; that is, the DACA solution and funding the \nFederal Government. Given our global security crisis--and I do mean the \nword ``crisis'' today--I think the world is more dangerous than any \ntime in my lifetime. I can't think of anything worse than to tie up the \nfunding for our men and women in uniform with an issue like this; that \nwe all want to solve anyway.\n  I am shocked the Democrats would advocate that we shut down the \ngovernment over a bill no one has even seen yet and an issue that has \nnothing to do with getting the government funded. Creating a false \ndeadline for a DACA solution, I believe--and using it to hold military \ncertainty hostage--is no way to govern. I think most people back home \nagree with that. That is what is wrong with this institution today. \nBoth sides need to stop it right now.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ned \nCullinan upon his retirement from the City of Waterbury, Connecticut's \nDemocratic Town Committee. Ned has been a true leader in the Waterbury \ncommunity for decades, ranging from his work as a builder of common \nground within a wonderfully diverse politically active city to his \nservice with a variety of local civic organizations.\n  A native of Waterbury, Connecticut, Ned took an active role in his \ncommunity and showed an interest in politics from a young age. He was \nelected Vice President of his senior class at Sacred Heart High School, \nand was an avid basketball player. He went on to play at Providence \nCollege, where he graduated in 1973.\n  Through his decades of community work, Ned has had a tremendous \nimpact, not only in Waterbury, but throughout Connecticut. Everyone in \nthe city's political community knows Ned for his tireless work to \nensure that all of the diverse voices of the city are heard by public \nofficials. He was first elected to the Waterbury Democratic Town \nCommittee in 1988, and then went on to serve as Second Vice Chairman, \nand finally as Chairman of the DTC for nearly thirteen years. In this \nrole, Ned worked with local, state, and federal leaders to ensure they \nwere accountable to Waterbury's residents and invested in the \ncommunity's success.\n  Ned has also been a leader in a number of civic organizations in the \nBrass City. He was Director of the Bunker Hill Sports Association for \nfifteen years, coaching basketball, baseball, and soccer. He has also \nserved as the President of the Holy Cross Father's Club and the Greater \nWaterbury Olympian Club. Professionally, Ned worked for United \nTechnologies for many years, retiring recently. I wish him an enjoyable \nretirement with plenty of time to spend with his wonderful wife Anne \nMarie and his loving family and many friends.\n  Mr. Speaker, Ned has been an instrumental leader in Waterbury, \nConnecticut for decades, using his time and talents to advocate for the \ncity and to bring our community together. It is therefore fitting and \nproper that we honor my friend, and a devoted Waterburian and Democrat, \nNed Cullinan here today.\n"], "Mr. GRAVES of Missouri": ["2018-02-27", "  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, on February 26, 2018, I missed a \nseries of Roll Call votes. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA \non No. 81 and 82.\n"], "Mr. WYDEN": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senator Hatch and I have introduced the \nRetirement Enhancement and Savings Act of 2018. This bill makes a \nnumber of improvements to our Nation's employer-provided retirement \nplans and is the result of several years of bipartisan work on the part \nof the Finance Committee. The Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act \nwas unanimously reported out of the Finance Committee in the prior \nCongress, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The bill that Senator Hatch and I have introduced is identical to the \nbill reported by the Finance Committee except for updating effective \ndates, omitting provisions that already have been enacted into law, and \nseveral technical modifications to the provisions impacting the United \nStates Tax Court and to the safe harbor for employers for annuity \nprovider selection.\n  The safe harbor for annuity provider selection is a critical change \nto current law that will encourage employers to offer annuities to \nemployees in 401(k) and other defined contribution retirement plans. \nMany employers are reluctant to offer annuities in these types of plans \nbecause of uncertainty about their liability in the event that an \ninsurer becomes insolvent and is unable to pay benefits under the \nannuity. This safe harbor provides certainty for employers who select \ninsurers who are financially capable of meeting their commitments and \nare in good standing with State regulators. The technical modification \nto the safe harbor is a one-word change that clarifies that the safe \nharbor is solely for the selection of the insurer and the possibility \nthat the insurer may not be able to make payments due under the \ncontract and is not a safe harbor for the selection of the contract. As \nunder existing law, the plan fiduciary remains required to prudently \nselect the type of annuity that is best for participants and \nbeneficiaries."], "Mr. HATCH": ["2018-02-26", "  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today marks nearly 2 weeks since the murder \nof 17 students and staff in Parkland, FL. May today also mark the \nmoment that we resolved to do something about school violence. May it \nmark the moment that left and right determined to lay aside their \ndifferences and work together to prevent future tragedies.\n  To keep our children safe from harm, there is no panacea, no one \nlegislative solution, and it disheartens me when I hear talk about what \ncan't be done. It is time to focus on what can be done.\n  Fortunately, solutions on the State level--including in my home State \nof Utah--can help show us the way forward. Working in the realm of the \npossible, Utah State legislators have come together to forge bipartisan \nsolutions to stop school violence. When I was in Salt Lake last week, I \nlearned firsthand about the Safe Utah smartphone app. The Safe Utah \ncrisis text and tip line is a statewide service that provides real-time \ncrisis intervention to use through texting and a confidential tip \nprogram. Licensed clinicians from the University Neuropsychiatric \nInstitute at the University of Utah Health respond to all incoming \nchats, texts, and calls 24/7 by providing supporting or crisis \ncounseling, suicide prevention, and referral services.\n  The Safe Utah Program--developed with funding from the Utah State \nLegislature in collaboration with the University Neuropsychiatric \nInstitute, the Utah State Office of Education, the Utah Office of the \nAttorney General, and the Utah Anti-Bullying Coalition--is a testament \nto what can be done when mental health, education, and law enforcement \nagencies work together to prevent student violence.\n  Not only is the app innovative, it works. Since the app was unveiled \nin 2016, 86 planned school attacks have been stopped. Think about that, \n86 school attacks stopped in a relatively small State. That number \ntranslates to dozens of lives saved and hundreds of heartbreaks spared. \nFor thousands of families across the State, this simple app made a \nworld of difference. Imagine the potential if these kinds of \ntechnologies were available to students across the country. We could \nquickly get help for those who need it and, in the process, save \ncountless lives.\n  That is why, later this week, I will introduce the Students, \nTeachers, and Officers Preventing School Violence Act, or the STOP \nSchool Violence Act. My bill makes Department of Justice grants \navailable to States to fund programs designed to reduce school \nviolence.\n  To that end, the STOP School Violence Act will fund four initiatives. \nFirst, it will provide grant funding for evidence-based training to \nprevent student violence against others and self, including training \nfor local law enforcement officers, school personnel, and students. \nThis is not just active shooter training but training designed to give \nstudents and teachers the knowledge to recognize and properly respond \nto warning signals or signals to stop school violence before it occurs.\n  Second, the bill will fund evidence-based technology and equipment to \nimprove security and prevent school violence. This includes the \ndevelopment and operation of anonymous reporting systems like the Safe \nUtah app, as well as improvements to school security infrastructure to \ndeter and respond to threats of school violence, and, when prevention \nefforts fall short--as they unfortunately will in some cases--locks on \nclassroom doors, reinforced entryways, and other commonsense security \ninfrastructure improvements will help.\n  Third, the bill will provide funding for the development and \noperation of evidence-based school threat assessment and crisis \nintervention teams, which may include evidence-based training for \nschool officials in responding to mental health crises. Again, school \npersonnel need the tools to assess and respond to threats before they \nmaterialize, including those threats that originate from individuals \nstruggling with mental health issues.\n  Finally, the bill will provide funding for continued coordination \nwith local law enforcement. Law enforcement alone cannot prevent school \nviolence--just as no amount of prevention training, security \ninfrastructure improvements, or mental health resources would be able \nto singularly prevent tragedies like that in Parkland, but law \nenforcement, and in particular those officers who already staff \nschools, have an important role to play in any comprehensive solution \nto prevent school violence.\n  Now, some of you may point out something my bill will not address, \nand that is guns. On this issue, many reforms have been proposed over \nthe last 12 days--some old and some new. I believe we can find common \nground here, too, such as that outlined in the bipartisan Fix NICS Act, \nwhich ensures that our background check system is operating as \ndesigned.\n  A background check is only as good as the records in the database. \nThe FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System is \ncurrently incomplete because many Federal agencies and States have not \nprovided all records that establish someone as prohibited from owning a \nfirearm under current law, especially those related to mental health \nadjudications and involuntary commitment orders.\n  The bipartisan Fix NICS Act will ensure more of those records make it \ninto the database by holding Federal agencies accountable for uploading \nrelevant records and incentivizing States to upload all relevant \ninformation. Including these missing records will help ensure more \naccurate and complete background checks, thereby keeping dangerous \nweapons out of the hands of felons, fugitives, drug addicts, persons \nwith serious mental illness, and other prohibited persons.\n  I will be the first to admit there is no single, perfect solution--\nnot the STOP School Violence Act and not the Fix NICS Act, but both of \nthese bills can help save lives. Remember the 86 planned school attacks \nsince the Save Utah app was unveiled and remember the 26 lives that \nmight have been spared if the domestic violence offense of the shooter \nin Sutherland Springs, TX, had been properly entered into the FBI \nbackground check database.\n  Now is not the time for argument but for action. Rather than letting \nthe perfect be the enemy of the good, I implore my friends on both \nsides of the aisle to come together for the safety of our children. \nRather than resorting to recycled talking points, I ask my colleagues \nto heed Minority Leader Schumer's call to ``pass real legislation that \nmakes a difference.'' Rather than retreating to our partisan foxholes, \nI call on Republicans and Democrats alike to surrender their rhetorical \nweapons. For the good of the Nation, and the good of our children, all \nof us must look beyond the horizon of our political differences to find \ncommon ground.\n  Is this legislation enough to solve the problem of school violence? \nNo. Quite frankly, it is not enough, but it is a start, and it is a \nstart upon which we can all agree. We will not solve the problem of \nschool violence overnight, but with incremental efforts--such as the \nlegislation I have proposed--we can make a lasting difference and even \nsave thousands of lives.\n  So let's not delay any further. We owe it to our children, and to all \nof those affected by gun violence, to take decisive action in those \nareas where we do agree. This is important stuff. We can't just throw \nin the sponge and act like we have this problem solved when we still \nhave work to do. So I hope we will take heed to what I have just \nsuggested--I think it can be very helpful to us--and we follow the \nsuggestions I have made here today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Mr. SCHUMER": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, later this afternoon President Trump \nplans to announce sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs. Let me say once \nagain, I believe the President's instincts on China are correct. All \nthose who are trying to push him away from his instincts will allow \nChina over the next decade to become the dominant economic power and \ngreatly hurt American jobs and American prosperity as well. So I would \nsay: Mr. President, stick to your instincts.\n  But while the President's instincts are correct, the execution on \nthese tariffs is poor. That is the difference here--not the instinct, \nnot that we shouldn't go after China, and not that we have to do more \nto bolster American wealth and American workers against rapacious \npolicies of China's. China will stop at nothing, nothing, nothing, to \nsteal our intellectual property and to manipulate its currency to \nexclude American companies from being there.\n  China has been rapacious about trade, and I have spoken about this \nproblem for years. Early on--I think it was 2004 or 2005--Senator \nGraham and I discovered that China was manipulating its currency. I \nheard it from Crucible steel up in Syracuse, NY.\n  The great thinkers said: They don't manipulate their currency. This \nis protectionist.\n  In the same week--I was quite proud of this--the New York Times \neditorial board, which is liberal, and the Wall Street Journal \neditorial board, which is conservative, both said: There is no such \nthing as currency manipulation, and Schumer and Graham ought to back \noff.\n  Of course, we proved to be right on that and other issues.\n  China is rapacious. If we don't stop China, America will be a weaker \nplace with fewer good-paying jobs, with less wealth, less strength, and \nwe probably won't stay the greatest country in the world--although we \ndeserve to because we play by the rules.\n  President Trump has identified the right opponent--China--much better \nthan both the Obama and Bush administrations did. Both Democrats and \nRepublicans have been blind to this issue, and Trump isn't. Good. But I \nwould say to the President: Don't swing blindly and wildly at our foe, \nChina. Establish a well-placed jab at China. Set them back. Let them \nknow we mean business.\n  President Trump ought to rethink his plan so it actually achieves \nwhat he says he wants it to achieve.\n  U.S. steel and aluminum workers have been battling heavily subsidized \nproducts from China for decades. I know. I have Nucor in my State, in \nAuburn and in Chemung County. On aluminum, I have Alcoa in my State, in \nMassena. Our steel and aluminum workers deserve a more level playing \nfield against these countries like China that heavily subsidize their \nproducts or other countries that purchase Chinese steel at artificially \nlow prices and ship it to the United States. A targeted trade action \nagainst China would be very helpful not only in providing relief for \nthe steel and aluminum workers in New York and around the country, but \nit would send a strong shot across the bow to China for the first time \nin decades: We mean business. We are not going to let you prey on us \nany longer.\n  Targeted trade against China and against countries that allow China \nto sell them steel at artificially low prices and then send it here, go \nafter them, but instead of getting right at China, the President's \nacross-the-board tariffs will cause more damage to key allies and other \ndomestic industries. I not only have steelworkers in Upstate New York, \nI have a lot of autoworkers. For instance, we are so proud of the GM \nplant in Tonawanda near Buffalo and the Ford stamping plant also in \nWestern New York. We are so proud of our agriculture.\n  Incidentally, the President is right, Canada has put in certain \nrestrictions on American dairy going to Canada that has hurt companies \nlike the Cayuga cooperative in Central New York and O-AT-KA in Genesee \nCounty.\n  We have to protect and help our workers in auto manufacturing and our \nfarmers who do export and who do good things. China doesn't let our \nauto products in, in a fair way, but other countries do--Canada does.\n  So the President's proposal does more harm to Europe and other allies\n\n\nlike Canada than it does to China. That is what is wrong with it. It is \nso typical of this White House. Even when they have a good idea, they \nmess it up because they don't think it through, and the President acts \nonly by his instincts. You have to act by your instincts and put a \nthought process on top of it.\n  The goal of the President to go after China was not really achieved \nvery well in his proposal. The haphazard way these tariffs were put \ntogether has caused policy to miss the mark. It seems no one is at home \nin the White House right now. President Trump makes up his mind one \nday, changes it the next, and meanwhile trade policies, foreign \npolicies, gun policies, immigration policies are all in chaos because \nhe says one thing one day and another thing the next. So we need the \nPresident to follow his instincts but then allow the people who know \nthis issue to craft something smart.\n  The President and I may agree on trade. As I said, we are closer on \nthis issue than I have been with either the Bush or Obama \nadministrations, but the slapdash way these tariffs were constructed \nhave few of us cheering, even those of us who really have wanted to go \nafter China long before politics was a gleam in President Trump's eye. \nWell, maybe that is not true; it may have been a gleam in his eye but \nbefore he ran for anything.\n  I strongly urge the President to rethink these tariffs and focus his \npolicy more directly at China and countries that ship cheap Chinese \nsteel to the United States. On the flip side, I am sure some of our \nbusiness interests will tell the President do nothing on trade.\n  The chamber of commerce--they are interested in the bottom-line \nprofits of their big companies, and they don't care if they make those \nprofits at the expense of American workers. They are not a barometer \nhere, and President Trump is right to ignore them. We have to be smart \nabout this--not just tough, but tough and smart. We need to get tough \nand smart on China, and the right approach is targeted action against \nChina's most flagrant abuses.\n\n\n                          Republican Tax Bill\n\n  Mr. President, on tax, since the Republican tax bill passed last \nyear, nearly every day there has been a new story about a corporation \nchoosing to pass along the savings from the tax law to wealthy \nshareholders and corporate executives because they buy back their \nstocks. They use this new tax money not to help their workers but to \nbuy back their stocks. In January, there was an initial flurry of all \nthese bonuses. They have been totally overwhelmed with stock buybacks. \nWhat Democrats said is proving to be true. The vast majority of this \ntax break is for the wealthy, by the wealthy, used by the wealthy to \nhelp themselves, not help workers. That has been the history when you \ngive these corporations lots of money, when they have so much money \nalready, without pointing it in the direction of helping workers.\n  Yesterday, Chevron joined the parade of those with stock buybacks. It \nwas Chevron who announced that while it was making no changes to \nworkers' compensation or benefits, it would be restarting its dormant \nstock repurchasing program. Do you know how much Chevron got from this \ntax bill? Mr. President, $2 billion. Do you know how much they are \ngiving their workers--or benefits--out of that $2 billion? Nothing. \nNothing as of now. Do you know what they are using it for? Stock \nbuybacks. Let our Republican friends come to the floor and defend those \nstock buybacks. Let them do that.\n  Today, another oil company, Hess, announced it would be purchasing \nback $1 billion of its stock by the end of the year. Since the start of \n2018, just in the last few months, the cumulative total of share \nbuybacks has passed $200 billion. Let me repeat that, $200 billion has \nbeen used for stock buybacks. The month of February set the 1-month \nrecord for share buybacks, and analysts at JPMorgan--hardly a liberal \nthink tank--says they ``expect total buybacks in 2018 to surpass $800 \nbillion, way up from the $530 billion last year and demolishing 2007's \nall-time high that came in a bit below $700 billion.'' That is not \nChuck Schumer or CPAC or any of these liberal think tanks, that is \nJPMorgan Chase.\n  So our poor Republican friends had hoped this tax bill would send \nthem on a trajectory to win elections and, by February, the numbers are \nstarting to turn against them again. Look at the Quinnipiac poll of \nyesterday. Why? Because, as this tax bill plays out, what Democrats \nsaid all along; that the vast majority of the benefits are going to the \nwealthy, it increases the deficit, and it increases the clarion call of \nmany on the Republican side to cut Medicare and Social Security to pay \nfor the deficit they created--it is not going over too well. We will \nmatch our argument against theirs now in October and November. We are \nconfident we are going to win that argument, and that is why already \nthe enthusiasm about this tax bill is fading.\n  The massive deluge of corporate share buybacks is proving to be the \nprincipal legacy of the Republican tax bill--not benefits to workers, \nnot bonuses, not wage increases, not even new equipment or investment \nin R&D. I would welcome that. Nope, corporations are spending the bulk \nof the savings from the tax bill on themselves, their corporate \nexecutives, and their wealthy shareholders.\n  Guess how much of the capital companies have earned from the tax bill \nhas been allocated to their employees, the workers who were going to \nget such huge benefits from this bill--6 percent. No, no, it is not 60; \nit is 6. Sixty is the percentage that has gone back to corporations in \nthe form of stock buybacks--a 10-to-1 ratio. It doesn't make much \nsense. The American public is beginning to realize that. Those are the \nnumbers according to Just Capital.\n  As I said, the American people are starting to catch wind of the \ntruth. Three separate polls yesterday--I mentioned Quinnipiac, and \nthere are evidently two others. Three separate polls show the \npopularity of the Republican tax bill was significantly underwater and \nhas lost ground since the last round of polling. I predict those \nnumbers will continue to slip as more Americans learn that their hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars were used to give a tax break to corporations \nwho hoard the savings for themselves. It is no wonder their candidate \nin a hard-fought race in Southwest Pennsylvania has abandoned the tax \nargument. It is not going over well with his working-class constituents \nbecause they get a tiny, little bit, and everyone else gets so much \nmore.\n  Mr. President, Democrats have a plan to rein in these buybacks and \nput the middle class first. Yesterday, Senator Baldwin and I announced \nan amendment to the pending banking bill that would rein in corporate \nbuybacks by giving the SEC the authority to reject buybacks that come \nat the expense of workers. Who will object to that? I hope not my \ncolleagues. They say the buybacks will benefit workers, so they \nshouldn't be objecting to our bill. Senator Baldwin's bill and my bill \nwould require company boards and their executives to put their money \nwhere their mouth is and certify that the buyback is in the best long-\nterm financial interest of the company.\n  We are going to make this one of the top amendments to the banking \nbill, and I hope it gains Republican support. If Republicans mean what \nthey say about their tax bill helping workers, they should join Senator \nBaldwin's amendment. The glut of corporate share buybacks highlights \nprecisely how the corporate tax cut in the Republican bill is being put \nto ill use. Rather than stimulating the economy, creating jobs, or \nraising pay, corporations are spending the lion's share of the tax \nsavings on goosing their stock.\n  Let's not forget, these buybacks are relatively new. A ruling by the \nSEC in the early eighties said they could start doing these. Before \nthat, the heyday, when corporate America dominated the world, profits \nwere great, jobs were growing, and wages went up, the safe harbor \nprovision wasn't there. Corporations had to go through a lot of proof \nbefore they could buy back their stock, and that made sense, but once \nour Republican colleagues got in power, they did what the corporate \nleaders want them to do and look what happened.\n  The amendment to say no buybacks unless they can prove it is really \ngoing to benefit their workers and be in the long-term financial \ninterest of their company, that amendment is going to be one of the top \namendments to the upcoming bill. I hope it gains Republican support. I \nreally do. If Republicans mean what they say, they should\n\n\njoin Baldwin's amendment, as I said before, but I want to repeat it for \nthe benefit of all my good Republican friends.\n  Now, the glut of corporate share buybacks highlights precisely how \nthe corporate tax cut in the Republican bill is being put to ill use. \nRather than stimulating the economy, creating jobs, raising pay, \ncorporations spend the lion's share of the tax savings on goosing their \nstock. Americans are just scratching their heads, wondering why we put \nourselves in deeper debt so corporations could further enrich \nthemselves. Why do we tell our children and grandchildren they are \ngoing to pay for the pay raise of the CEO of Exxon or the increase in \nvalue because his stock is going up? That doesn't make any sense at \nall. There are much better uses for the money.\n  Yesterday, Democrats announced our plan to help build a trillion \ndollars of desperately needed infrastructure in America. How do we pay \nfor it? We unwind some of these tax cuts for the biggest corporations \nto pay for a massive infusion of Federal funds in infrastructure--job-\ncreating infrastructure, which is desperately needed. Just by putting \nthe top rate on individuals where it was, reinstituting the AMT and the \nestate tax, which goes only to the very wealthy, and setting the \ncorporate rate at 25 percent--you may recall it was the Business \nRoundtable that asked for 25 percent. Oh, no, for our Republican \ncolleagues and Donald Trump, that wasn't good enough. Make it lower--\neven though the 200 biggest businesses in America said 25 percent was \ncertainly an adequate drop. Many on my side wouldn't even think that is \ngood.\n  In any case, the BMT asked for 25 percent. We go to 25 percent, along \nwith these other changes, and guess what we do with $1 trillion. We \ncreate infrastructure jobs--millions. We create new roads and bridges, \nnew water and sewer. We say that every rural home in America should get \nbroadband just as Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s said every rural \nhome should get electricity. We update our power grid so all this new \nenergy coming from other places can go to the most populated centers. \nIt would be a huge shot in the arm for jobs in America, for prosperity \nin America, far more than this slanted tax bill aimed so much at the \nfew wealthy who are so tight with this new Republican Party.\n  I daresay our proposal is a much more effective use of taxpayer \ndollars than a handout to the biggest corporations and will create far \nmore good-paying jobs in the process.\n  I hope our Republican colleagues will rethink things. Their path is a \npath to a cul-de-sac, to great losses in the election. Rethink that tax \ncut. Don't allow these buybacks. They are doing no good for anyone but \na handful, and that is where 60 percent of the money is going on the \ncorporate rate.\n  Join us in taking some of that money to do what the Federal \nGovernment has done since Henry Clay proposed it in the 1820s: Put that \nmoney into infrastructure, jobs, good-paying jobs, efficiency. Let's \nnot let China or another country become the leader in infrastructure. \nThey invest. The Chinese Government, the Japanese Government, the \nEuropean Government invest in infrastructure, and so did this \ngovernment, until Donald Trump became President and the hard right \ngained a stranglehold over the Republican Party. Let's reverse course \nbefore it is too late.\n\n  I yield the floor."], "The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan)": ["2018-03-08", "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan).\n  The Senator from Oklahoma."], "Mr. BROWN": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, well, not exactly. Yesterday I spoke about \nthe big banks that have violated our banking laws time and again, banks \nlike Wells Fargo and Citigroup. I talked about foreign banks like \nSantander and Deutsche Bank--the President's personal German bank, I \nmight add. Santander, a Spanish bank, has foreclosed on the cars of \nAmerican service men and women when they are overseas serving our \ncountry, and we are rewarding that Spanish bank. We are rewarding a \nSwiss bank that has broken international law in support of Iran. We are \nrewarding these foreign banks.\n  I liked this bill at the beginning. I have been working on these \nissues with Chairman Crapo, whom I respect--I really do--for some \nyears, and we worked on coming up with a bill that would help community \nbanks and the midsized regional banks, three of which are located in \nthe Presiding Officer's boyhood State and my State of Ohio--Fifth \nThird, KeyCorp, and Huntington. We wanted to do those things.\n  You know, in this place, when we work on something to help the small \nguy, the big guy thinks: Well, don't leave me out. I want to be part of \nthis. I want to get my things too.\n  So we start helping community banks, we start helping the little guy, \nand all of a sudden, Wall Street gets its hand out, just like on the \ntax bill. I guess I believed my colleagues on the tax bill when they \nsaid it was a middle-class tax cut bill. Well, it kind of didn't end up \nthat way. By the end, 81 percent of the tax benefits went to the \nrichest 1 percent.\n  That is what we do. We start here. We go back home, and we talk about \nhelping the middle class and helping the little guy. No matter whether \nshe punches a time clock or works construction, we want to help middle-\nincome people. But you know what--by the time the lobbyists swoop in, \nby the time they are here, and they start talking to their friends and \nstart doing what they do, then all of a sudden, these bills help the \nbig guy.

The neighborhood that I live in is not a gated community. I \nlive in an area of about 200 relatively new homes. When I drive about \n500 yards in any direction, I see the blight that came because of what \nWall Street and, frankly, this Congress and the regulators, the Bush \nregulators--I can mention names; it is all public record--did to our \neconomy. And 10 years later, we have kind of forgotten about all that.\n  Well, the people who lost their homes haven't forgotten about it. The \npeople who lost their jobs haven't forgotten about it. The people who \nlost their retirement savings haven't forgotten about it. It is just a \nbunch of Members of Congress, a bunch of Republican members of the \nBanking Committee, a bunch of Members on that side of the aisle--almost \nall of whom, I believe, are supporting this bill--they seem to have \nforgotten what happened to the economy 10 years ago.\n  After starting with a relatively simple and benign, let's help the \ncommunity banks and the credit unions--which I want to do, too, and \nhave a voting record to prove it--and help some of the smaller \nregionals, such as Huntington and Fifth Third and Key Corp in my State, \nit just sort of got out of hand.\n  Well, now they are coming back and saying: Well, we will make a \ncouple of changes. Let's talk about these couple of changes that \nHoudini would be proud of, sort of some sleight-of-hand kinds of \nchanges. In fact, these changes have made the bill worse, and I will \nexplain.\n\n  Last September, we learned that Equifax had allowed hackers to \nexploit a known security flaw and make off with names, birth dates, \nSocial Security numbers, and all matter of private information of 143 \nmillions Americans. There are probably 50 people in the Gallery. If the \nnational averages hold out, 25 of them were wronged by Equifax. They \nwere fraudulently or incompetently--perhaps through incompetence--\nattacked by Equifax. In my State, it was about 5 million people. Around \nthe country, it was about 143 million. In fact, most of the people in \nthe Gallery are adults, so it is more than half the adult population \nthat was wronged by Equifax. Half the country is vulnerable to identity \ntheft.\n  Americans are furious with Equifax, as they should be, but this \namendment that apparently is in the substitute bill for reasons I can't \nfathom includes provisions designed to help Equifax. It is not just \nthat this body doesn't punish Equifax and that these executives have no \ncontrition--of course nobody went to jail.\n  The people we send to jail in this country--we almost never send \npeople to jail for financial fraud. They dress well, they are \nsophisticated, they belong to the right country clubs, and they would \nnever go to jail. Let me back off on that for a moment and talk again \nabout Equifax.\n  Equifax and other credit reporting agencies apparently have been \nupset about a proposal to give men and women in the military credit \nmonitoring. Think of that. Equifax executives didn't like that there \nwas a proposal to give the people serving this country credit \nmonitoring.\n  I understand what Santander did; they repossessed autos of men and \nwomen from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton and from other \nplaces who were overseas serving. They repossessed their cars, and we \nrewarded them, so I guess Equifax thought, well, there is a good trend \nhere, a good precedent there. We don't want to give men and women in \nthe military credit monitoring.\n  So we have an amendment to fix that. A small gesture to the people \nwho serve our country, though, seemed too much for the Republicans and \ntoo much for Equifax. In exchange for this token benefit, they demanded \nthat consumers and servicemembers give up their right to take Equifax \nto court. So Equifax is willing to do a little bit for people, just a \nlittle bit, but damn it, you can't sue us then. That was the deal--you \ncan't sue us. We will give you a little bit of credit monitoring, but \nin return, you can't sue us for anything. I am not a lawyer, but that \nis called a right to action. So the next time the company's \nrecklessness exposes sensitive financial data, sorry, you can't sue us. \nSorry about that; that is the way it goes.\n  In the end, Equifax--shocking--got exactly what it wanted. Equifax \nlet your data loose and ruined your credit score, but you won't be able \nto sue them. Sorry about that.\n  It gets worse. Equifax--a company that can't even safely store \nconsumers' data--and that is their job; that is what they are hired to \ndo, even though we don't individually choose them. The company spent \nnearly as much on executive salaries as it did on cyber security. So \nthis company's job is to protect private data, but they didn't really \ninvest that much in cyber security\n\n\nbecause, for whatever reason, they paid their executives about the same \namount of money.\n  Now Equifax wants in on the credit-scoring business. Along with two \nother major credit reporting agencies, it has created a product to \ncompete with Fair Isaac's FICO score.\n  The Federal Housing Finance Agency has a process in place to try to \nbroaden the factors it looks at in determining creditworthiness, but, \nas Director Mel Watt testified in the Banking Committee, it is \ncomplicated and it is time-consuming. Understandably, FHFA wants to get \nit right, and so do the lenders that sell loans to Fannie and Freddie. \nBut instead of allowing FHFA to take the time it needs to get it right, \nthis bill ignores that, and it sets up its own process. We have not \ntaken any testimony on this legislation from market participants or \nfrom the government agency. I have my hunch, though, as to who is \npushing for it. Guess who is one of the biggest beneficiaries of this \nchange. The pages would know the answer to that, if they are listening. \nEquifax, of course.\n  I know my colleagues were well-intentioned. It would be great if we \nhad additional ways of determining whether someone is creditworthy and \nif we could give more Americans the opportunity to become homeowners. \nBut determining creditworthiness and balancing access to credit with \nthe need to make sure we don't end up with millions of foreclosures is \ncomplicated. That is why we have FHFA, and that is why we have a \nprocess in place.\n  We know there are problems with the current system, and more data \nwould improve our efforts to combat discrimination in housing. The \nCenter for Investigative Reporting just completed a valuable study of \ntens of millions of mortgage records and found out that across the \ncountry, people of color are far more likely to be turned down for a \nloan, even when you take into account factors like income and the size \nof the loan. I will repeat that. Holding all things equal except for \nrace, people of color are far more likely to be turned down for a loan. \nWe know that.\n  The trade associations for lenders argued that the study was flawed \nbecause more data--data like credit scores and debt-to-income ratios--\nwas needed to prove discrimination. The good news is that Dodd-Frank \ndid that. It required this very kind of data to be collected, and \nbeginning in January, banks and credit unions began reporting it.\n  Problem solved, right? Well, once the more detailed data set is \navailable and large enough, watchdogs can then undertake better \nanalysis, target the bad actors, and allow the good lenders--and most \nof them are--to continue with their business without a regulator \nknocking on their door. But who are we kidding? This bill wants to do \naway with that too. I thought we had solved the problem. The substitute \nwould repeal the reporting required by Dodd-Frank for 85 percent of all \nbanks.\n  Backers of the substitute will claim it has addressed complaints that \nthis effort will undermine enforcement of civil rights laws, but it \nhasn't. Backers will point to a provision which says that banks that \nflunk the Community Reinvestment Act exam and get a rating of \nsubstantial noncompliance are ineligible for the reduced reporting of \nmortgage data. That sounds good, but in all of 2017, out of the \nthousands of Community Reinvestment Act exams, only two banks out of \nthousands flunked. When we have reason to believe banks all across the \ncountry are discriminating in their lending, even if it is \nunintentional--and sometimes it is--looking at data from two banks out \nof thousands isn't going to tell us a whole lot.\n  The substitute would maintain current laws for banks that are given a \n``needs to improve'' rating on their CRA exam over two consecutive exam \ncycles. Let's say a bank is engaged in discriminatory lending. The \nexaminer gives it a ``needs to improve'' rating. This amendment says: \nNo harm, no foul; the first one is free. Really? A few years later, \nwhen the next exam rolls around, if the bank is still discriminating, \nonly then will it have to submit to the amount of data required today. \nSo this amendment says it is OK for a bank to engage in legally \nsanctioned discrimination for years before it faces any consequences. \nWhy would we do that in this bill?\n  In sharp contrast to the slow-motion response to discrimination, when \nit is the bank that wants the data from the Federal Government, the \nsponsors of this bill can't move fast enough. It is like everything \naround here--when Wall Street says ``jump,'' most of this Senate jumps, \nand frankly, straight down the hall in the House of Representatives, \nthey jump faster and higher.\n  There was a bill introduced just this Monday, referred to the Finance \nCommittee, that would allow credit card companies to tap the Social \nSecurity Administration database to verify identities. There hasn't \nbeen a hearing on it, and it hasn't gotten attention, but guess what--\nit is in the substitute bill. So the banking majority can move very \nfast when it comes to helping the banks; they can't move so fast when \nit comes to prohibiting discrimination against people of color. I \nsuppose I understand why, but that is pretty outrageous. The demand on \nSSA would explode. Will the system be able to handle it? Will the \npublic interfere? Will this public interface be one more way that \nhackers could gain access to the Social Security database? I don't know \nbecause there has been no time for the Finance Committee to look at \nthis bill. Protecting people's Social Security numbers is the last \nplace--the last place--where we should be rushing things to please the \nbig banks.\n\n  Whether it is a State as conservative as Tennessee or as liberal as \nCalifornia, I am guessing most Americans don't want Congress to rush \nsomething through that might expose their Social Security numbers \nwithout really understanding it through congressional hearings and \nexamination.\n  This would all be bad enough, but it is not just Equifax that gets \ngoodies in this bill. This bill is a gift to foreign megabanks. \nYesterday we saw a new provision on foreign banks included in the \nsubstitute to clarify the legislation, but it doesn't fix the issue. \nThe substitute includes a figleaf to try to convince the public that \nthis bill doesn't do what it actually does do.\n  This provision provides some vague and ambiguous language that puts \nthe question to the Fed. In this bill, we say: You can regulate the \nforeign banks or you don't have to regulate the foreign banks; it is up \nto the new Federal regulators. It is your choice. The legislation \ndoesn't require the Fed to keep strong rules in place that are already \nin place. It doesn't stop the foreign banks from suing the Fed if it \ndoesn't obey the request.\n  We are expected to trust Randal Quarles to be tough on foreign \nbanks--most of you don't know Randal Quarles. I have had conversations \nwith him. He is a smart man. He is well educated. He is a nice guy--but \nthat is not a bet I want to make. That is not a bet Congress should \nmake.\n  Just this week, Governor Quarles spoke at an international banking \nconference, and he promised--it was an international banking \nconference. That would probably not be with Wells Fargo, probably not \nJPMorgan Chase, probably not Bank of America; it would probably be with \nSantander, UBS, Swiss Bank, or Barclays--the British bank--or the \nPresident's personal bank, the German bank, Deutsche Bank. Those are \nwho attended. He said, if we really want to fix the foreign bank \nissue--he said he plans to deregulate those foreign banks.\n  I know the supporters of this bill think they can sort of obfuscate--\nI don't think they are lying. I think they are just obfuscating and not \nreally being straightforward about what this bill does for foreign \nbanks, and I know they did this for foreign banks because I asked \nTreasury Secretary Mnuchin--Senator Corker was in the room with the \nBanking Committee--and he said: Yes, we plan to deregulate the foreign \nbanks.\n  We know that. We know that from other former regulators: Paul \nVolcker, former head of the Federal Reserve appointed by both President \nCarter and President Reagan; we know that from people like Sarah Bloom \nRaskin, who was a member of the Board of Governors at the Federal \nReserve; we know that from professors and other regulators. I know \nSheila Bair, a Republican nominee appointed by President Bush to run \nthe FDIC, is concerned about this bill. We know that.\n  So if we want to fix the foreign bank issue, let's just adopt my \namendment. Let's fix it. It is simple: No favors for\n\n\nthe biggest global banks here in the United States. Don't give the \nregulators the option because we know whom the regulators for the banks \nare. We know most of the regulators for the banks used to work on Wall \nStreet. You go to the White House, and the White House looks like a \nretreat for Wall Street executives.\n  We want to write strong laws, clear laws. We don't need to place \nblind trust in the people who have failed us before--Quarles, Mick \nMulvaney, Otting, and Mnuchin. We are expecting these people who have \nbeen strong in their public announcements to be right in their public \nactions? We are entrusting these people who have profited--I could name \nthe names. We are entrusting these people who now have public service \njobs and who have profited from Wall Street malfeasance to protect our \neconomy and our country from Wall Street malfeasance.\n  I take the side of Paul Volcker, Sheila Bair, Tom Hoenig, Barney \nFrank, Sarah Bloom Raskin, Phil Angelides, Antonio Weiss, and Michael \nBarr. They are all people who have counseled us--all good public \nofficials, all former regulators. Not quite half, but a number of them \nare Republicans, and some are Democrats. They are all people who \ncounseled us to vote no on this bill and whose concerns have not been \naddressed by this substitute.\n  In addition, the substitute raises $675 million to pay for the \nprivilege of deregulating the banks, but all it could manage on lead \npoisoning in housing was a report from HUD.\n  Where are our priorities? The Congressional Budget Office said this \nbill makes it more likely they will need a bailout, more likely to lead \nto a bailout for the big banks. So $675 million of taxpayer money is \nsquandered instead of doing infrastructure, instead of dealing with \nlead. That is part of the issue we dealt with in our committee. That is \nwhy I supported Secretary Carson for his confirmation, because I \nthought he was going to do something about lead. Shame on me for \nbelieving that, when I have seen nothing so far.\n  Instead of those $675 million going to Wall Street, wouldn't it be \ngreat if we could direct those hundreds of millions of dollars to \nprevent children from developing developmental disabilities brought on \nby lead?\n  Remember, I talked about my ZIP Code, 44105. Look at those houses. \nDrive through Cleveland. Drive through Memphis. Drive through Omaha. \nDrive through all kinds of cities in this country. You will see houses \nthat were built in 1950 or before, and 80 or 90 percent of them have \ntoxic levels of lead. We have sentenced millions of American children \nto live in those homes.\n  This is called the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. We \nhave done nothing in this committee for the last 5 years--not a damn \nthing--about getting that lead out of those homes and stopping the \npoisoning of children. We could be doing that but instead we are giving \nmore to Wall Street.\n  This substitute doesn't make this bill better. By papering over its \nfundamental problems, by treating servicemembers as second-class \ncitizens--think of Santander, think of the amendment Senator Reed from \nRhode Island is working on--we are opening up the Social Security \nsystem to possible threats. It represents a step backward.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the substitute and the underlying \nbill.\n  I yield the floor."], "Mr. TOOMEY": ["2018-02-15", "  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, Kate Steinle didn't have to be shot and \nkilled on a pier in San Francisco. A 13-year-old child didn't have to \nbe raped in the city of Philadelphia by Ramon Ochoa. Both of those \ncrimes were committed by people who were in this country illegally \nafter previously committing multiple crimes and after having been \ndeported. In both cases, the\n\n\ncities in which these crimes occurred--the police departments--had \nthese criminals in custody shortly prior to the commission of these \ncrimes. But in both cases, when the Department of Homeland Security \nasked for a temporary detention until they could take these people into \ncustody and deport them, that was not allowed because these were \nsanctuary cities. These sanctuary cities systematically forbid the \nlocal police from even sharing information or cooperating with Federal \nimmigration officials, even in the case of criminals.\n  My amendment is a bipartisan amendment. I want to thank the Senator \nfrom West Virginia for cosponsoring it. This is an amendment that will \nensure that any legal liability for wrongful detention is held by the \nFederal Government, and nonsecurity funds--CDBG grants and some other \ncategories--will be withheld from sanctuary cities."], "Mr. CORNYN": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I guess I have to give my friend, the \nSenator from New York, credit. Once he made his bed, he decided he had \nbetter lie in it.\n  Democrats made a risky gamble when they bet against the American \npeople in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that we passed in December. No \nDemocrat supported it--none--and now I think they are beginning to \nworry that it is actually working. Otherwise, I don't understand why \nthe Democratic leader, the minority leader of the U.S. Senate, would \nsay: We need to raise your taxes because we can spend your money better \nthan you can. I guess he means that we also need to eliminate the \ndoubling of the standard deduction, which makes sure that the first \n$24,000 earned by a married couple is tax-free--zero tax rate. I guess \nhe thinks we ought to repeal the doubling of the child tax credit.\n  As much as he rails about corporations, the fact is, what we did on \nthe business side with taxes has made the United States more \ncompetitive globally. It is the same argument that he, President Obama \nin a State of the Union speech, and the ranking member of the Senate \nFinance Committee, Senator Wyden--it is the same argument they made \nthat we embraced.\n  We got a little more aggressive than they did in terms of the rate. \nWe lowered it, not to 25 percent, as Senator Wyden had proposed, but to \n21 percent; thus, we made ourselves roughly average in the \nindustrialized world, making America more competitive. We were seeing \npeople going overseas and investing because they had better tax rates \nthan we had here in America.\n  Who owns the stock? You have heard the Democratic leader talk about \nstock buybacks. He said: Well, these corporations are using this money \nto buy their own stock back. Do you know who owns stock in America? I \nam not sure of the exact percentage, but a huge percentage of it is \nowned by retirement funds and pension funds of firefighters, teachers, \nand others who want to see that their retirement is not only safe but \nalso grows. What they have seen since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was \npassed in December is the value of their retirement funds go through \nthe roof. The stock market is at an all-time high--or thereabouts. It \nhas set huge records.\n  I know our friends on the other side of the aisle are worried because \nthey made a dangerous gamble against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but the \nfact is, all the polling is showing that as people are seeing the Tax \nCuts and Jobs Act actually being implemented, they are seeing more \nmoney in their paychecks. Because the withholding tables were changed \nto reflect lower tax rates, people are seeing more take-home pay. And \nas the economy continues to grow, there is going to be more competition \nfor workers.\n  Unemployment claims are the lowest they have been since 1969. As \nthere is more competition for workers, that is going to force employers \nto pay more wages, so everyone is going to benefit from a growing \neconomy.\n  Sometimes I think our colleagues across the aisle have settled for \ntoo little. They settled for a stagnant economy, frozen wages, and an \nAmerica that could no longer compete in the world when it came to \nattracting business and investment. We changed that.\n  Every single person on this side of the aisle--all 51 of us--voted \nfor the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Everyone on that side of the aisle voted \nagainst it. I think the Democratic leader now is getting pretty \nworried, especially leading up to the November elections, when a number \nof his colleagues on that side of the aisle are going to have to go to \nvoters and say: I voted against your pay raise; I voted against take-\nhome pay; I voted against increasing the standard deduction; I voted \nagainst an increase in the child tax credit. I think they are pretty \nworried about it; otherwise, I couldn't imagine the Democratic leader \ncoming out here and saying what he said today.\n  He said: Well, we want to raise your taxes so we can spend it. I \nthink the folks I represent--the 28 million Texans I represent--would \nsay: No thank you. We want to spend our own hard-earned money the way \nwe see fit, not send it to Washington to see it go into some black \nhole, and then we will not know what we actually benefited from.\n  I didn't necessarily intend to come to the floor to talk about that, \nbut I couldn't resist responding briefly to my friend's comments.\n  Mr. President, I do want to congratulate the senior Senator from \nIdaho for a moment, Mr. Crapo, the chairman of the Banking Committee, \non the bill that is pending on the floor. He has done stellar work to \nbring this Dodd-Frank reform bill to the floor, one that will release \nsome of those shackles on small community banks and credit unions.\n  They were the victims of overkill when it came to regulation under \nthe name of Dodd-Frank, which was designed to address Wall Street and \nthe excesses of Wall Street. But as I have told my friends who are \ncommunity bankers and members of credit unions back home: You weren't \nthe target, but\n\n\nyou were the collateral damage. We are going to remedy that on a \nbipartisan basis, thanks to the Banking Committee, its chairman, \nSenator Crapo, and our colleagues.\n\n\n            Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\n\n  Mr. President, this morning, I want to mention another area where the \nBanking Committee and Senator Crapo are showing great leadership, and \nthat is on a bill that will improve the CFIUS review process. Let me \nunpack that.\n  CFIUS is the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. \nThat acronym stands for the interagency body led by the Treasury \nDepartment, in this case by Secretary Mnuchin. It polices foreign \ninvestment in the United States for national security risks.\n  The Banking Committee has held two hearings on the bipartisan bill \nthat I introduced with the senior Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, which is called the Foreign Investment Risk Review \nModernization Act. I hope the committee will have a markup on that bill \nsoon.\n  The House Financial Services Committee has also been holding hearings \non our bill, including one last week, and has more planned in the \nfuture.\n  The time to act is now because this process is outdated, and the \ncommittee's jurisdiction remains too narrow. Let me explain why that is \nso important.\n  This review process was not originally designed, and is now \ninsufficient, to address today's rapidly evolving threats to our \nnational security. Perhaps most alarmingly, many transactions that \ncould pose a national security risk often go unreviewed altogether.\n  In particular, China has proved adept at cheating the current CFIUS \nsystem. It exploits gaps and creatively structures investments in U.S. \nbusinesses to evade scrutiny. They literally have been vacuuming up \nstartup technology firms that are going to produce the next cutting-\nedge technology that would give America a competitive advantage against \nthe rest of the world when it comes to our national security, and they \nare thinking strategically in the long term by showing up as investors \nin some of these businesses and flying beneath the radar screen. They \nare unreviewed under the current CFIUS process.\n  To circumvent review, China will often pressure U.S. companies into \narrangements like joint ventures and coerce them into handing over \ntheir technology and their know-how. This enables Chinese companies to \nacquire and then replicate U.S.-bred capabilities on their own soil, \ndestroying jobs here in America in the process, as well as our \nindustrial base. Many of these technologies have a direct military \napplication, and my bill, cosponsored with Senator Feinstein, addresses \nthis problem.\n  As we speak, China is turning our own technology and know-how against \nus and seeking to erase our national security advantage little by \nlittle. They are doing it relentlessly and strategically. This massive \ntechnology transfer, which occurs out of the public eye and is achieved \nthrough China's deliberate campaign of evasion of our security \nsafeguards, must end.\n  We don't have to look very far to see how technology is increasingly \nthe realm where U.S. national security interests and China's economic \nand military interests lie in tension with one another or, in the worst \ncase, they actually collide. It is happening almost every day.\n  Consider the widely reported news this week that CFIUS--the Committee \non Foreign Investment in the United States--has ordered a full \ninvestigation into a foreign bid to take over a prominent American \ncomputer chip manufacturer. That company, Qualcomm, plays a leading \nrole in supporting U.S. telecommunications infrastructure, especially \nby doing the research and investment of 5G technology, which is \nimportant for autonomous vehicles and the internet, increasing the use \nof cellular technology for what is transforming our lives. It supports \nour national security through classified work in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The cause for alarm is that the deal is a hostile takeover, and the \nconsequences of the takeover could put China in the driver's seat for \nthe next generation of mobile technology.\n  Chinese companies, beholden as they are to the Chinese Communist \nParty, would fill any void that is left once the deal is complete, much \nto the detriment of our national security and our economy.\n  We are still gathering information, and not all the facts are known \nyet, but I want to stress that we need to do our due diligence. We need \nto have a comprehensive review of this hostile takeover. In my view, \nCFIUS, with Secretary Mnuchin leading at the Treasury Department, is \nright to be extremely cautious and to investigate this matter further.\n  Today there is a growing recognition that foreign investors are \ngetting more sophisticated in accessing our technology. As this week's \ndevelopments show, we can't be naive in thinking that this isn't \nhappening or that it is not a clear and present danger or naive about \nState-owned enterprises in countries like China, where there is no such \nthing as the private and public sector. The government controls \neverything because that is the nature of their Communist system.\n  The Chinese Government has plans to dominate mobile technology, \nquantum computing, artificial intelligence, and other industries; that \nmuch is clear. One tactic is to force American companies to transfer \nhigh-tech industrial capabilities to China's homegrown players in \nexchange for the U.S. firms gaining access to the Chinese market. That, \ntoo, is well documented. But the quid pro quos don't stop there. They \naren't even confined to the technology space.\n  Recently, there have been calls to investigate China's involvement in \nAmerican college campuses through the so-called Confucius Institutes. \nThese institutes are proxies for the Chinese Communist Party. They \noffer schools financial benefits in exchange to set up shop in close \nproximity to U.S. researchers and students whose views they attempt to \ninfluence for what are essentially manipulative propaganda campaigns--\nones that conveniently whitewash over the Communist regime's less \nflattering attributes and their troubling history of human rights \nabuses and belligerence in places like the South China Sea.\n  I know our colleague, the junior Senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio, who \ncochairs the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, has called on \nschools that host Confucius Institutes to end those partnerships, and \nhe is right to do so. Steady and stealthy forms of information warfare \nshould be a perpetual concern, especially when none other than Gen. Joe \nDunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that by 2025, \nChina will pose the greatest threat to U.S. national security of any \nnation.\n  The bipartisan bill Senator Feinstein and I have introduced is an \nimportant piece of our overall response to this threat. It has been \nendorsed by the administration and is supported by the current \nSecretaries of Defense and Treasury, as well as the Attorney General. \nLet's not hold this up any longer.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the Banking Committee for the good \nwork on the bill that is on the floor. I thank him for his leadership \nand willingness to work with us on this important CFIUS reform bill. I \nlook forward to the upcoming markup of this bill in the committee soon.\n\n\n                             Fix NICS Bill\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me say that every day that goes by since \nthe shooting in Parkland, FL, on February 14--every day that goes by, \nwe are distracted by other concerns, and our memories dim of the \nterrible mass tragedy that occurred at that school, the shootings that \noccurred there that day.\n  I know the Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, was at Stoneman \nDouglas High School yesterday for the students' first full, normal \nschoolday, 3 weeks after the shooting. She said it was a sobering \nmoment--and I am sure it was--speaking to the students and teachers, \nwho still flinch remembering the sounds of bullets in the hallways of \ntheir school. Fourteen students died, along with one teacher, the \nschool's athletic director, and a coach who was shielding students with \nhis body so they would not be hit.\n  That is the thing about these events--these stories make us sad and \nangry and sometimes numb, all at the\n\n\nsame time, but from these stories, from these tragedies, heroes do \nemerge.\n  We saw one of those heroes last fall at Sutherland Springs, TX, where \npeople were gathered to worship at a small Baptist church just outside \nof San Antonio. A man who prefers not to be recognized grabbed his \nrifle and ran to the church that was under attack, and he saved lives \nin the process by preventing the gunman from continuing the carnage. \nThat is a case of somebody taking an AR-15 out of his gun safe. He is a \ncertified shooting instructor. He came to the aid of people who were \ndefenseless and who were being slaughtered at that church, and he saved \nmany lives.\n  The person who was shooting at that church in Sutherland Springs was \na convicted felon, and he was, under existing law, legally permitted to \npurchase or possess firearms. That is why, when I came back to \nWashington after visiting Sutherland Springs at the next Sunday \nservice, I introduced a bill to fix the holes in the national instant \nbackground check system--to make sure that shooters like the one at \nSutherland Springs could not legally purchase firearms.\n  Part of the reason I did that was because after I talked to Pastor \nFrank Pomeroy, who lost his daughter Annabelle in the massacre, I \npromised myself I would do everything in my power to prevent similar \nevents from occurring in the future. I did the same after I spoke with \na man by the name of Andrew Pollack, who lost his daughter Meadow in \nFlorida last month. I met Andrew last week, along with Senator Rubio, \nwho I know has been similarly moved to take action.\n  After having these difficult conversations, I can't tell my \ncolleagues how disappointed I am that the Senate has done nothing--\nnothing--to prevent them from happening in the future. We can't even \ntell fathers and mothers that we have taken the first step toward \nending some of the violence that plagues our country, that puts bullet \nholes in our classrooms and spills blood inside some of our most sacred \nplaces.\n  The bill that I introduced to fix the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System is called Fix NICS. That is what it does. It \nfixes the holes in the background check system so that people like Mr. \nKelley, the shooter at Sutherland Springs, could not legally purchase a \nfirearm. I am grateful to my colleagues who have cosponsored that bill. \nIt includes the majority leader and the minority leader, Senator \nSchumer, as well as Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal from \nConnecticut and all of our close to 60 bipartisan cosponsors. They \nbelieve that what the bill tries to do, which is to fix our broken \nbackground check system, is important and will save lives and will keep \nguns out of the hands of convicted felons.\n  Recently, we saw that the bill could make a real difference in places \nlike Ohio. There, it was reported that dozens of courts are failing to \nupload conviction records into the FBI National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System and that this failure could result in convicted \nfelons purchasing guns. This bill would help alleviate that problem. A \nsimilar glitch is one that allowed the gunman in Sutherland Springs, of \ncourse, to purchase the firearm he used when the Air Force failed to \nupload his conviction records into the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System, as they were obligated to do. The law requires \nthat these convictions be uploaded, and now we need to make sure those \nlaws are enforced.\n  Sixty is how many votes we need to pass this legislation in the \nSenate, and I am confident, were that bill to be brought to the floor \nand we had a vote on it, it would actually get many, many more--close \nto unanimity--here in the Senate. Last week we tried to get an \nagreement to have a debate on the bill followed by an up-or-down vote. \nSadly and inexplicably, the minority leader blocked that agreement. I \ndon't think the minority leader opposes the bill--he is actually a \ncosponsor of it--but he is in a bind. He is being pressured by a \nhandful of those in his conference who say that this is not sufficient.\n  I know people on both sides of the aisle would like to do more, but I \nwant to make sure we don't fail to do anything at all or that we don't \nend up doing nothing. Many of these Members have indicated that they \nwant votes on other measures. Frankly, I would be fine with that, but \nlet's make sure we don't leave here another day emptyhanded by failing \nto take action on the one consensus piece of legislation that would be \nsupported by an overwhelming majority of the Senate.\n  I would like to be able to report good news to Pastor Pomeroy and his \nwife Sherri. I am sure my colleagues from Florida would like to do the \nsame for the shocked families who are still grieving in Parkland. We \nneed to send a message to families that when they drop their children \noff at school and when they go to church to worship, they will be \nsafe--or safer than they would be if we fail to act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor."], "The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer)": ["2018-03-08", "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from Tennessee."], "Mr. SULLIVAN": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, as many of my colleagues know, one of \nmy favorite parts of the week is coming down to the Senate floor to \nrecognize somebody special in my State, somebody we refer to as our \n``Alaskan of the Week.'' It is one of the most fulfilling things I do \nall week, to get to talk about people who make my State very, very \nspecial.\n  I know many of you--people in the Gallery--have seen Alaska on TV or \nhave read about it in the newspapers, but there is no substitute for \nbeing there. We want you all to come. It would be the trip of a \nlifetime, particularly now.\n  What is going on in Alaska right now, one of the highlights of the \nentire year, is the Iditarod--the ``last great race'' in the world--\nwhich is in full throttle. When you visit, Alaska will change your \nlife--the wilderness, the wildlife, the quiet, the sense of unbridled \nfreedom, the liberty, and the majesty. It is all there. It is all \nthere, so come on, come on and visit.\n  Also, when you visit, you will realize that Alaska is home to some of \nthe most courageous, hard-working, and tenacious people in the world, \nmany of whom have overcome tremendous odds and are determined to \ninspire others to live a full and healthy life.\n  Madam President, I would like to take you, take everybody listening, \nto Nome, AK, and tell you about Carol Seppilu, someone who I believe \npersonifies determination and perseverance and who is an inspiration to \nus all and is this week's Alaskan of the Week.\n  Carol lives in Nome--a rugged, unique, and beautiful town in Alaska's \nnorthwest, about 500 miles from Anchorage. You might have heard of \nNome. The reality show ``Gold Rush Alaska'' was filmed there, and it is \nalso the finish for the Iditarod.\n  Pretty soon, if you are watching on TV--our best guess is early next \nweek--the mushers and the dozens of dogs--that, by the way, love the \nrace. They love the race--will begin to cross the finish line. People \nfrom all over our State, but really people from all over the world, \nwill be there to greet them as they finish this incredible race, to \ngreet them and congratulate them. We call it the ``last great race,'' \nand it finishes at Nome.\n  There is no place like Nome, we like to say in Alaska. If you live in \nNome, you might have seen Carol running in winter, spring, summer, and \nfall. Carol runs through the streets and into the mountains surrounding \nNome. It is one of the ways that she has found purpose in her life, \nwhich in turn she has used to help others, to inspire others.\n  Like a lot of us, Carol had big dreams when she was growing up. She \nwas interested in science and space. She was actually interested in \nbeing an astrophysicist. Then, as sometimes happens to young kids, her \nlife took a bit of a turn. She got in with the wrong crowd and started \ndrinking and using drugs, and her life lost meaning.\n  This is a difficult subject to talk about on the Senate floor, but we \nmust. We must. Carol wants us to. Alaska has the second highest suicide \nrate in the country, and it has the highest teen suicide rate in the \nentire\n\n\nNation. The suicide rate among Alaska Native teens is also very, very \nhigh--tragically high, horribly high. When it comes to suicide, silence \nis deadly.\n  Carol knows all about this. When she was 16, she tried to end her \nlife by shooting herself. After the gun went off, she remembers \nthinking: Dear God, save me. I don't want to die anymore.\n  Then she described how, during this awful incident, her ancestors \ncame to her, her elders, telling her that she was going to be OK and \nthat she had a reason to live. She did live. Badly scarred, after \nhaving multiple operations on her face, recovery has not been easy for \nCarol, but she has made it through. She has toughed it out.\n  What she did was remarkable and incredible. She began to speak about \nsuicide at schools. She was a member of the State's Suicide Prevention \nCouncil. Eventually, she got a job at an elders' home, where she is \ncurrently the cultural activities specialist. She organizes Alaska \nNative dances. She cooks traditional Alaska Native food for her elders. \nMoose and muskox soup is their favorite. I think Senator Murkowski is \ngoing to let us enjoy a little muskox stew over lunch today, so Carol \nwill be pleased about that.\n  But as the years went by, she again experienced depression, which is \nnot uncommon. She didn't feel like getting out of bed. She was \nunhealthy. But then again, in 2014, more inspiration--again, \nincredible. A high school friend who was a runner urged Carol to try \nit. You are not feeling healthy? You are feeling sad? Go out, try to \nget a run in. At first, when she did it, she could only go a few \nblocks. Eventually the blocks turned into miles, which is even more \nchallenging for her because of some of her injuries. Nonetheless, she \npersevered.\n  We are seeing a theme in her life. She began to get healthy and to \nfeel good about herself again. Again, she found her reason to live. \nGuess what. She has turned into an amazing athlete. She began to enter \nraces in 2015 when she ran the local 8-mile Dexter Challenge. ``I \nthought, if I do eight miles, I could do a half marathon,'' she said. \nAnd then she did.\n  Carol didn't stop there. Now she is running ultramarathons across the \ncountry--50 miles in Iowa, multiple ultramarathons in Utah, a 50K in \nWashington State. Early last month, she was running a 50K in Texas \nwhen, about 5 miles in, she broke her ankle, but that didn't stop her. \nShe finished even with a broken ankle and is recovering. We are seeing \na woman, a young lady of perseverance. Her ultimate goal is to do an \nultramarathon in every State in America.\n  Because of Carol's scars, she wears a mask. In August she decided \nthat it was too cumbersome to wear the mask while running, so during a \nrace in Alaska--the very challenging 50-mile Resurrection Pass \nultramarathon--she took it off, and it was liberating for her. Here is \nthe beautiful thing: Everybody--everybody--was so supportive, so she \ndoesn't run with a mask anymore.\n  It is not only runners who are supportive of Carol; she has gotten \npeople in her hometown, the town of Nome, to start running themselves. \nAcross the State, people approach her wherever she goes, and they tell \nher they have heard about her, they have heard about her life, and if \nshe has made it through her challenge, they can too. In other words, \nshe is an inspiration. She has become an inspiration throughout Alaska \nto so many people. She said:\n\n       I think I'm helping other people overcome difficulties. \n     They tell me I'm inspiring them to keep going. So that's why \n     I believe I'm here now--to help others.\n\n  That is Carol's quote.\n  So, Carol, for your inspiration to so many in our great State, for \nall you have done and all you continue to do, we are proud of you and \nthank you for being our Alaskan of the Week this week, as the Iditarod \nfinishes up in your hometown of Nome, AK.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Mr. DURBIN": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas. I \nlistened carefully to his words about gun safety, and I agree with so \nmuch of what he said. He talked about bringing his bill to the floor. I \nthink his bill is a good bill. His bill tries to provide more \ninformation into the NICS system. We definitely need to do that. He \nalso said he was open to amendments on the floor. I am as well. I think \nthere are other aspects of gun safety that we may even find common \nground on as well. But I might remind him that the decision about the \nbusiness on the floor of the Senate is in the hands of his side of the \naisle.\n  It is your decision to decide, through your majority leader, what we \nconsider on the floor of the Senate. An effort to do this by unanimous \nconsent is certainly understandable in light of the events of the last \nfew weeks, but if Senator McConnell were to announce that as soon as we \nfinish this banking bill, we are going to move to the Fix NICS bill and \nhave it open to amendment, I think he would find support from both \nsides of the aisle to do that. I hope he will, because things are \nchanging in America, as they should. Gun violence and the terrible \ntragedies that occurred in Texas and in Florida and in so many States \nhave really raised consciousness of this issue.\n  I am a grandfather and proud to be. I have two 6-year-old twins who \nare first graders in Brooklyn, NY. They are the cutest kids in the \nworld, and I am very objective about that.\n  About 2 weeks ago, my little granddaughter came home from the first \ngrade and said to her mom: Mom, they told us at school that if there is \na shooter outside the school, stay away from the windows, and if a \nshooter comes in the classroom, get on the floor.\n  First grade. Is there any sane person in America who thinks that \nshould be a normal talk in the first grade classroom? Is there any \nperson, constitutional scholar or not, who believes the Second \nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States was designed to \nallow this to happen? I can't imagine.\n  Ninety-seven percent of the American people believe in universal, \ncomprehensive background checks to keep guns out of the hands of those \nwho would misuse them, including convicted felons and mentally unstable \npeople--97 percent. The overwhelming majority of gun owners feel \nexactly the same way. So why in God's Name have we not taken that up \nsince the tragedy in Florida and the tragedy in Texas? There is no \nexplanation for it other than fear--fear of the National Rifle \nAssociation and the gun lobby. That is the only explanation.\n  I salute the legislators in the State of Florida who this last week \ndefied the NRA and defied the gun lobby and passed their own measure \nfor gun safety. I don't agree with parts of it. Giving cafeteria \nworkers in schools the right to carry arms around the school--I don't \nthink that is a wise thing at all. I understand that there is \nopposition to that from teachers' organizations and even Republican \nleaders in Florida. But they did stand up when it came to questions \nabout how old you have to be to buy a firearm, a long gun, and other \nquestions that I think are just common sense.\n  So I would say to my friend from Texas, the majority whip, what you \nsaid is something I can support. Bring your bill to the floor, open to \namendment. Let us have our day in the Senate where we actually act as \nlegislators, where people will come to the\n\n\nGalleries and not see an empty Chamber but instead will find Members of \nthe Senate, 100 strong, Democrats and Republicans, at their desks, \ndebating measures that make a difference in the life of America. That \nis why we are sent here.\n  I had a friend of mine years ago when I served in the House--he was a \nCongressman from Muskogee, OK. His name was Mike Synar. He was a dear, \nclose friend of mine. Mike lost his primary in Oklahoma because he was \nfearless. He used to come to the floor when we had votes, and he would \nsee Members of his own caucus kind of wincing, afraid to vote for \nsomething they knew was right for fear of the political consequences. \nHe used to get right in their faces. Mike would say: If you don't want \nto fight fires, don't be a firefighter. If you don't want to stand here \nand debate controversial issues and vote on them, don't run for \nCongress.\n  Mike was right. He was right then, and he is right now.\n  Let's bring gun safety to the floor of the Senate. Let's open it to \namendments. Let's have a fulsome, bipartisan debate. We understand that \nnothing is going to pass without bipartisan support. We should do \neverything in our power to exercise the power and the right we are \ngiven as U.S. Senators to fix the problems facing American families. \nThis is a problem.

Sheriff's Deputy Scott \nStone, Sheriff's Sergeant Jacob Abendschan, and Colorado Springs Police \nOfficer Marcus Yanez, along with a bystander, were also wounded in the \nattack.\n  A total of 10 law enforcement officers in Colorado have been wounded \nor killed since December 31. On January 24, Adams County Sheriff's \nDeputy Gumm was fatally wounded. Another assault on law enforcement \nofficers on New Year's Eve in Douglas County resulted in the death of \nJefferson County Sheriff's Deputy Parrish and wounded four other law \nenforcement officers.\n  These three attacks left four children without fathers and countless \nloved ones with a loss they will never forget.\n  Micah Flick was killed on his 11th anniversary with the El Paso \nCounty Sheriff's Department and leaves behind a wife and 7-year-old \ntwins.\n  Micah was a hero who, according to the Colorado Springs Gazette, was \nremembered by his brother-in-law as someone who ``never wanted to do \nanything else but protect this community.'' His fellow sheriff's \ndeputies would always tease him that he was ``the poster boy of the \nsheriff's office.''\n  Micah's wife Rachel captured her husband's heroism perfectly when she \nexplained how she would always tell him to just do his job and not be a \nhero but understands that was not in his DNA. ``Micah was a hero, and \nhe couldn't help it,'' she said. Micah's fellow deputy who was wounded \nin the attack confirmed Micah's heroism. Deputy Stone told Sheriff Bill \nElder: ``Micah saved my life, and I will be forever grateful.'' Micah \nwas a hero that day, and no one will ever forget that.\n  Unfortunately, I have come to this Chamber far too many times just \nthis year to honor a fallen Colorado law enforcement officer and repeat \nthe words\n\n\nfor the third time of LTC Dave Grossman, who wrote that American law \nenforcement is the loyal and brave sheep dog, always standing watch for \nthe wolf that lurks in the dark.\n  We owe so much to Micah and his brothers and sisters in blue who \nprotect our communities each and every day. I know that all of our \nfamilies together sleep better at night knowing these heroes are out \nprotecting every single one of us.\n  Thank you, Micah, for answering the call. You protected your \ncommunity. You saved your fellow officers. You are a hero. And I, along \nwith Coloradans across the State, am forever grateful.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate Black History \nMonth and to pay tribute to a Pennsylvanian who has dedicated her life \nto public service.\n  Today, we honor former Philadelphia councilwoman Marian Benton Tasco, \nwhose 50-year career in public service has improved the lives of \ncountless people in our State. Throughout her career, Marian Tasco \nconsistently fought for the people of her community. From her first \ndays as a typist working in the city of Philadelphia to the end of her \nseventh term serving on\n\n\nthe city council, Marian Tasco's life has been dedicated to helping \npeople. Today we celebrate Marian's commitment to public service.\n  Born during the days of segregation in Greensboro, NC, Marian Tasco \nwas joyfully raised through the love and care of her mother, Mazie \nBenton; her great-grandmother, Susie Short; and her grandparents, Alice \nand Thomas Benton. At an early age, Marian expressed an interest in \ncommunity service through volunteer activities with the Brownies and \nGirl Scouts of America. Even as a child, Marian Tasco was inspired to \nhelp others.\n  It was at this point in her life that Marian imagined that she would \ngo on to become an educator. With that goal in mind, she began her \neducation at Bennett College, a historically Black liberal arts college \nfor women, which is located in Greensboro. Marian worked during the \nsummers to pay for her tuition. After 2 years, Marian had to leave \nBennett when she could no longer afford to pay the cost of tuition. \nLater in life, Marian would return to Bennett College as a member of \nthe board of trustees and actively work to support the growth of the \ncollege.\n  After leaving Bennett, Marian Tasco moved to Philadelphia to be with \nher family and to continue her education at Temple University. Again \nworking to pay her way through school, she attended classes at night \nuntil her graduation.\n  While she maintained a strong interest in serving others, she decided \nthat, rather than education, politics and government would be her venue \nfor service. In 1959, Marian began her work for the city of \nPhiladelphia as a clerk typist I in the Philadelphia Police \nDepartment's Pawn Brokers Division. As a result of her diligent work, \nnot long thereafter, she was promoted to clerk typist II. In this new \nrole, she was reassigned to the registrar's office of the Philadelphia \nMuseum of Art.\n  Like many others who have served the public, Marian Tasco's story in \npolitics began on the frontlines of the community--the community she \nwould later go on to serve.\n  Under the leadership of a distinguished lawyer, Charles Bowser, \nMarian served as a task force coordinator for the Greater Philadelphia \nUrban Affairs Coalition. This is an organization that she continues to \nserve today as a board member. One of Marian's greatest accomplishments \nwas the creation of a youth-focused summer work program that still \nexists today. Her experience at the Urban Affairs Coalition affirmed \nher interest in public affairs and community outreach and helped \nincrease her understanding of the needs of the African-American \ncommunity in Philadelphia.\n  As her career progressed and new opportunities emerged, Marian Tasco \nremained committed to the path of service. Following her work as an \nassistant to the former secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \nC. Delores Tucker, Marian brought her passion for service to the office \nof the late U.S. Congressman William H. Gray III. He also, of course, \nserved as House majority whip and chairman of the Budget Committee. She \nworked as both campaign manager and director of constituent services \nfor Congressman Gray.\n  Serving with Secretary Tucker and Congressman Gray made Marian Tasco \nworthy of recognition, but Marian wanted to do more. She decided that \nwith her years of experience in community activism and public service, \nshe would seek elected office. It was at the urging of Marian's mentor, \nformer Representative, City Councilman, and Secretary of Public Welfare \nJohn White, Jr., that she made the decision to seek elected office.\n  In 1983, Marian became the first African American elected \nPhiladelphia city commissioner. Instantly, she helped develop voter \neducation and registration programs in the city and worked to grow \ncivic education focusing on Philadelphia's young people.\n  In 1988, Marian began her first term on the Philadelphia City Council \nas a representative for the ninth district of the city. For over 27 \nyears, she served in a number of communities, including East Oak Lane, \nWest Oak Lane, Mount Airy, Olney, Logan, Lawncrest, and Oxford Circle. \nShe would go on to be reelected seven times and pioneer initiatives to \nimprove the quality of life for Philadelphians young and old.\n  Throughout her tenure in office, Councilwoman Tasco's role continued \nto grow in responsibility and scope. She eventually rose to serve as \nPhiladelphia City Council's majority leader, as well as majority whip.\n  Marian Tasco has served as ward leader for the 50th Ward of \nPhiladelphia for the last three decades. She was also unanimously \nelected by the Pennsylvania Democratic State Committee to represent \nPennsylvania on the Democratic National Committee. In this DNC role, \nCouncilwoman Tasco's reach grew beyond Philadelphia into the national \npolitical arena.\n  She helped institute meaningful change in Philadelphia and literally \nacross the Nation. Among other issues, she worked to fight predatory \nlending, and her work in that area positively impacted the lives of \nmany Philadelphians. Her commitment to ``protect Americans from \nunscrupulous dealings of financial institutions'' spanned both Broad \nStreet and Wall Street and helped inspire some of President Barack \nObama's work. Her advocacy on this issue dates back to the early 1990s, \nwhen she worked with community organizations to alert Philadelphia \nresidents about the potential harm of money offered by loan sharks. In \n2004, she briefed then-State Senator Obama on the issue during his \ncampaign for the U.S. Senate. In commemoration of her efforts, \nPresident Obama invited Councilwoman Tasco to join him for the signing \nof the historic Dodd-Frank legislation.\n  Marian Tasco's accomplishments in public office made Philadelphia a \nbetter place to live and work, and the people of Pennsylvania's largest \ncity remembered. Her retirement celebrations had over 1,200 attendees, \nincluding elected officials, labor leaders, community leaders, clergy, \nand, of course, constituents--the people she served. Councilwoman Tasco \nis a beloved figure throughout the city of Philadelphia and beyond. She \nis beloved by her peers and those she represented as a councilwoman.\n  Marian's work in public service was a shining example for others to \nfollow. Philadelphia mayor and former city council member Jim Kenney \nand former mayor and councilman Michael Nutter have both cited the \ncouncilwoman as a mentor. In fact, Mayor Kenney even noted that \nCouncilwoman Tasco ``raised him'' from the age of 32, when he was a new \ncouncil member.\n  She also has a proven legacy of recognizing and developing young \ntalent on her own team. Two current members of the Philadelphia City \nCouncil, Derrick Green and Cherelle Parker, and the late Judge Brenda \nFrazier-Clemons all served as members of her staff.\n  Councilwoman Marian Tasco's lifetime of service has been the subject \nof commendation. She has received a notable list of awards and honors, \nincluding an honorary doctorate of laws degree from Lincoln University. \nHer years of work to improve the city of Philadelphia resulted in a \nlifetime appointment to the Board of Directors of City Trusts, the \nPhiladelphia Cultural Fund, and the Pennsylvania Convention Center \nAuthority Board, just to name a few. For her advocacy on behalf of \nbehavioral health programs and work to push local healthcare reforms, \nthe former Lindley Court senior living apartments were renamed in her \nhonor.\n  Marian Tasco has spent the better part of her life working to improve \nher community, and she has inspired the next generation of public \nservants. As we celebrate this Black History Month, we honor those who \nhave made a real commitment to serve others. Marian Tasco has always \nhonored that commitment.\n  On behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the city of \nPhiladelphia, and all those whose lives have been impacted and inspired \nby her work, it is my privilege on this day to pay tribute to Marian \nTasco, a former member and leader of the City Council of Philadelphia \nand a devoted public servant who worked her way from clerk typist I to \ncitywide leader with national impact.\n  Well done, Marian.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak a little \nbit about the rule of law and President Trump's approach to what has \nhappened as far as the Mueller investigation.\n  The rule of law has protected our Nation's democracy, institutions, \nand citizens for over 200 years. It means that no one person is above \nthe law--no one--not even the President.\n  President Trump does not seem to respect the rule of law. He acts as \nif the law doesn't apply to him. He believes that he can steer the \nwheels of justice in whichever direction he wants to shield himself \nfrom lawful investigation.\n  This President is willing to risk national security, to defy the \njudgment of the FBI Director and his team, and to release classified \nmaterial for his own political purposes. Think about that. The \nPresident of the United States just declassified a top-secret document, \nand he did it with the clear intent to undermine the investigation into \nRussian interference in our election. His actions should end any doubt \nabout his willingness to obstruct justice.\n  After he declassified the Nunes memo, President Trump said: ``A lot \nof people should be ashamed of themselves. It's a disgrace, what's \nhappened in our country.'' This is one of the rare times I have agreed \nwith President Trump. It is a disgrace, what has happened in our \ncountry, but not for the reasons the President gives.\n  Russia's cyber attacks and other potential operations during the 2016 \nelection represented a direct strike at our democracy. I cannot think \nof a time when our national interest has been so threatened and the \nPresident of the United States has ignored the threat. Not only has \nthis President turned a blind eye to Russia's interference, but he has \ndone nothing to prevent future attacks. He ignores the threat even \nthough the CIA Director says Russia will try to interfere in our \nelections again. Instead, he has done everything he can to curry favor \nwith Vladimir Putin. He should be ashamed of himself.\n  Unfortunately, he has demonstrated time and time again that he is \nincapable of shame. But he is not alone. Many members of his party \nshould be ashamed for enabling the President to undermine the special \ncounsel investigation, for enabling his defamation of career public \nservants, and for remaining silent in the face of a growing crisis.\n  The President has made clear that he does not like Special Counsel \nMueller's and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein's independence and \ncommitment to the rule of law, and he has had an eye on getting rid of \nthem for quite a while. We learned he considered firing them last June, \nand we have known for many months, from the President's own admission, \nthat he fired FBI Director James Comey to stop the Russia \ninvestigation. These men have dedicated their lives to serving our \ncountry. Mr. Mueller served as a Federal prosecutor and a Department of \nJustice lawyer for much of his career, and he was appointed as FBI \nDirector in 2001 by\n\n\nPresident Bush. Mr. Rosenstein is also a career Federal prosecutor and \nwas appointed as a U.S. attorney by President George W. Bush.\n\n  The President has said many times: ``There was no collusion.'' If \nthat is true, why does the President go to such great lengths to \nundermine the investigation?\n  The President's intentions are transparent and dangerous. He fails to \naccept that Mr. Mueller and Mr. Rosenstein swore an oath to the \nConstitution. Because they will not pledge their loyalty to him, he is \nbound and determined to stop the investigation into his potential \nwrongdoing.\n  But the Republican leader has delayed bringing forward bipartisan \nlegislation to protect Mr. Mueller from arbitrary dismissal. In light \nof recent events, Congress must act. The special counsel needs \nprotection to do his job. He shouldn't have interference from the \nPresident and his partisan supporters.\n  In the Senate appropriations bill for the Department of Justice, I \nincluded language directing the Department of Justice to abide by its \ncurrent regulations for the special counsel, but it is clear to me that \nwe must do a lot more.\n  During the Watergate investigation, Eugene McCarthy said: ``This is \nthe time for all good [people] not to go to the aid of their party, but \nto come to the aid of their country.''\n  It is time for all Members of Congress to come to the aid of our \ncountry and ensure that Mr. Mueller and his team are able to gather the \nfacts and draw their conclusions without obstruction.\n  It is astonishing that President Trump still calls the Russia \ninvestigation a ``witch hunt.'' Our government's 17 law enforcement and \nnational security agencies all reached the conclusion that Russia \nactively interfered with our Presidential election through hacking \nnational party computers, leaking information, and spreading \ndisinformation over media and social media outlets. The President's \ncontinued refusal to address this threat is unconscionable, and it \nbetrays our national interests. Mr. Mueller's investigation into \nRussian interference is justified by the evidence, and it is \nimperative.\n  We also have abundant evidence that the President tried to interfere \nwith the Department of Justice and FBI investigation. The President's \nfiring of FBI Director James Comey because of ``the Russian thing'' is \nwhat landed him with a special counsel in the first place.\n  Why did the President want a pledge of personal loyalty from Mr. \nComey and Mr. Rosenstein? Why did he ask Mr. Comey to drop the \ninvestigation of Mr. Flynn?\n  Why is the President so angry at Attorney General Sessions for \nrecusing himself from the investigation, and why did the President need \nthe Attorney General to not recuse to ``protect'' him?\n  The evidence of interference with an ongoing investigation is enough \nreason to investigate. We all remember that President Nixon's chief \ntransgression was the coverup. Despite a constant refrain of denials \nfrom the President that his campaign had any connection with Russia, we \nknow there were many connections.\n  Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pled guilty to lying \nto the FBI about his December 22, 2016, conversation with the Russian \nAmbassador about relieving U.S. sanctions imposed for Russia's \ninterference. Campaign foreign adviser George Papadopoulos pled guilty \nto lying to the FBI about his contacts with people connected to the \nRussian Government. Former campaign manager Paul Manafort was charged \nin a Federal indictment with acting as a foreign agent for the pro-\nRussian Ukraine Government. The President's son, Donald Trump, Jr., and \nhis son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Mr. Manafort all met with Russian \noperatives to gather dirt on Hillary Clinton. Then, the President \npersonally dictated a press statement misrepresenting the nature of the \nmeeting. These are just a few of the connections.\n  Mr. President, I refer to a November 13, 2017, article from the \nWashington Post. It chronicles many of the meetings between the Trump \ncampaign officials and the Russians during the campaign and is too long \nto go into here.\n  But neither the compelling evidence justifying investigation nor Mr. \nMueller's credentials have stopped the President and his friends in \nCongress from attacking both. Representative Nunes nominally recused \nhimself from the Trump collusion investigation in the House \nIntelligence Committee, but he and his colleagues on the committee have \nnow released a memo based on incomplete and misleading information, \nwith the President's full backing. This is despite a warning from the \nFBI against its release, and the Speaker will do nothing to rein in him \nor his committee members.\n  The President's attacks on the independence of our Nation's premier \nlaw enforcement agency mirror his attacks on our other foundational \ninstitutions. He has maligned the judiciary. He has maligned the press. \nHe attacks and disrespects our foundational principles--separation of \npowers, freedom of speech and religion, and equality under the law. \nThis is in addition to the President's regular assault on the truth. \nThe Washington Post counted at least 2,000 times where this President \ndeparted from the truth in his first year in office.\n  The White House and its allies in Congress must stop their baseless \nattacks on Mr. Mueller and his team. They must let them do their job \nand find the facts. We must ensure the independence of prosecutors so \nwe can ensure that investigations and outcomes are fair and impartial.\n  Why is the President going to such lengths to fight this \ninvestigation? We do not know. But we do know that a foreign power--\nRussia--interfered in our last election, and we do know that the \nPresident and his team have had significant business links to Russian \nfinancial interests.\n  The President's family business continues today, but it does so while \nconcealing his tax returns and keeping their business partners secret. \nOn top of that, the Trump administration has become much more \naccommodating of Russian interests. Are these things connected in some \nway? We need to know. That is why the special counsel's investigation \nis so important.\n  Now is the time for every Member of Congress to put the country ahead \nof politics. Special Counsel Mueller must be able to do his job, to \nfollow the facts wherever they may lead, and to draw his conclusions. \nCongress must pass legislation to protect the special counsel from \nbeing arbitrarily fired, not serve as the President's lieutenants in an \nunprecedented assault on the rule of law.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Mr. BOOKER": ["2018-01-21", "  Mr. BOOKER.

Mr. President, Republicans control every level of the \nFederal Government. They hold majorities in the House and the Senate. \nThey have the Presidency. Yet the very people--the Republicans--who set \nthe agenda in Washington and have majorities in both the House and the \nSenate are desperately trying to convince the American people that a \ngovernment shutdown should be blamed on anyone else but them. Give me a \nbreak.\n  Nobody wants a shutdown except, maybe, the President, who seems to \nrelish a government shutdown as a way of ``shaking things up,'' \nregardless of who gets hurt. Members of Congress should know better, \nand Republicans should get down to business and negotiate with \nDemocrats in good faith.\n  Republicans in the House and Senate have brought us to the brink of a \nshutdown because they are terrified of the ideological extremists in \ntheir own party who reject even the most reasonable bipartisan \ncompromises. They are terrified of a mercurial President, who changes \nhis mind on a whim, who explodes at even the most minor slights, and \nwho has repeatedly said that maybe we need a good government shutdown \nso he can get his vanity wall. Donald Trump and the Republicans will be \nheld responsible for any government shutdown. They have created this \nsituation, and the American people will hold them accountable.\n  Democrats have been open and transparent about the things we are \nfighting for. We are fighting to reauthorize the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, CHIP, so 9 million kids across the country can \ncontinue to access the lifesaving healthcare they need. We are fighting \nto restore funding to community health centers that serve millions of \nunderserved Americans in rural communities, whether they live in \nKansas, Ohio, or any of the other States Trump won. We are fighting to \nprotect the Dreamers who could be deported to countries they know \nlittle of because the President unnecessarily and cruelly ended the \nDACA Program. We are also fighting for parity in funding for defense \nand domestic spending in any budget deal.\n  These are not partisan Democratic priorities. If one were to put each \nof these priorities up for a vote, they would all pass with bipartisan \nsupport in the House and the Senate. In fact, we could have passed each \nof these bills a long time ago. Yet, instead of doing something that \nwould actually help people, the Republicans spent months working as \nhard as they could behind closed doors to give the wealthiest 1 percent \nof the people in our country and corporations huge tax cuts. Now they \nare trying to convince the other 99 percent of the American public that \nthis tax bill was a good deal for them, but that is another story and \nis another example of misplaced priorities.\n  In getting back to the matter at hand, which is the urgency of \npreventing a government shutdown, the House is trying to pass another \nshort-term spending bill that only includes a reauthorization for \nchildren's health and not the other important priorities we need to \nsupport. The Republicans in Congress are trying to pit communities, \nchildren, families, and Dreamers against one another in an attempt to \ndivide and conquer. They are hoping we will support yet another \ngovernment funding bill that kicks the can down the road because they \nwill have funded children's health, even as, in their bill, they \nabandon the Dreamers and the rural communities that depend on community \nhealth centers.\n  We cannot allow this cynical Republican ploy to succeed. We need to \nkeep fighting for children's health, for community health centers, for \nDreamers, and for parity. I will not vote for any government funding \nbill that does not include all four of these important and urgent \npriorities. We cannot leave anyone behind because it is clear Donald\n\n\nTrump will not keep his promise to protect those we call the DACA kids.\n  I was at the White House last week when the President looked us in \nthe eye and said on national TV that he would sign a bipartisan \ncompromise on the Dreamers. He barely waited for us to leave the White \nHouse before reneging on that promise. Then we all know what happened \nlast week during the meeting with Senators Durbin and Graham at the \nWhite House when he was presented with a bipartisan compromise.\n  We cannot let the President's irresponsible behavior stop us from \nfighting for Dreamers who deserve our support and protection, Dreamers \nlike Getsi from Beaverton, OR, whom I met late last month when she \ntraveled to Washington, DC, to fight for the passage of the Dream Act. \nGetsi's parents brought her to Oregon from Mexico when she was only 4 \nyears old. The journey was long and hard, and Getsi's sister was left \nbehind.\n  While growing up, Getsi's parents warned her not to talk about her \nimmigration status because even mentioning it to the wrong person could \nresult in their deportations. She lived in constant fear. While growing \nup, Getsi's parents always emphasized the importance of her obtaining a \nhigher education, and while her mom and dad only completed the 5th and \n12th grades, respectively, they instilled a love of learning in their \ndaughter and a deep desire to go to college.\n  After working hard in high school, Getsi enrolled in Western Oregon \nUniversity, where she is studying to become a gerontological nurse. \nGetsi works incredibly hard. She is taking 20 credits a semester. I \nremember, when I was in college, 15 credits was a lot. She is taking 20 \ncredits a semester, is working full time at an assisted living \nfacility, and has recently become a certified rock climbing instructor. \nGetsi is scheduled to graduate a year early, in May, from Western \nOregon University. After graduation, she is planning to enroll in an \naccelerated nursing master's program so she can realize her dream of \nbecoming a gerontological nurse practitioner.\n  When I asked what inspired her to pursue such a selfless career, \nGetsi talked about wanting to care for people like her grandmother back \nin Mexico and for her parents as they got older. Without the \nprotections DACA provides, Getsi will lose her work authorization, and \nif she is not able to work, she will not be able to pay for school and \nwill be unable to pursue her dreams.\n  When I asked her why she traveled for days to come to Washington to \nshare this message with Congress, her response was very moving. She \nsaid:\n\n       I have so many dreams and aspirations, and I urge people \n     here to understand how much these Dreamers have to give to \n     the U.S. We were brought at such a young age, we don't know \n     anything about our homelands. I want to be able to stay in \n     the U.S., to stay with my friends and family--my nieces and \n     nephew--everyone who is looking up to me. I want to prove \n     that my parents' sacrifice meant something.\n\n  This is a pivotal moment for Congress. Are we going to do more than \npay lip service to Dreamers like Getsi by doing our jobs to protect \nthem and provide healthcare to millions of children and families across \nthe country or are we going to bend to the whims of an unpredictable, \nmercurial, and unreliable President?\n  Rather than waiting for the President to make up his mind, I call on \nthe majority leader to recognize that as a separate branch of \ngovernment, Congress should be a check on the excesses of the executive \nbranch. It is about time the majority leader and Republicans in \nCongress stepped up to do their jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Mr. CARDIN": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to recognize March as Women's \nHistory Month and today, March 8, as International Women's Day.\n  Both at home and abroad, how a country treats its women is very much \na barometer of its success. When women live without limitations on \ntheir ability to work, societies prosper. When women live without \nrestrictions on their access to jobs, healthcare, or justice, societies \nprosper. When women succeed, so do their families, their communities, \nand their countries.\n  International Women's Day reminds us that America's global leadership \nstarts with our progress here in the United States. Unfortunately, \nPresident Trump moved the United States in the wrong direction when he \ndecided not just to reinstate the global gag rule but to expand it. The \nglobal gag rule disqualifies international organizations from receiving \nU.S. family planning assistance if they use any non-U.S. funds to \nprovide abortion services or even counseling.\n  What President Trump fails to realize is that access to the family \nplanning services that these organizations provide is one of the best \ntools we have to prevent abortions. When enforced, the global gag rule \nhas closed the door on some of the most effective, lifesaving women's \nhealth programs in developing countries. By reinstating and expanding \nthe global gag rule, President Trump is denying millions of women and \ntheir families access to critical healthcare services and is \nendangering their lives and the lives of their children.\n  International Women's Day is the appropriate time to remind my Senate \ncolleagues that we must end the global gag rule once and for all.\n  It was also recently reported that the State Department is removing \nreferences to women's rights from this year's human rights report. I am \ntroubled to learn that the Trump administration, apparently, doesn't \nfeel that women's rights are important enough to include in our \nconversation on human rights. I was equally troubled to learn that the \nState Department removed gender equality integration from the Foreign \nAffairs Manual. The Foreign Affairs Manual is the chief document for \ninstructing our foreign policy leadership on the ways to integrate \ngender considerations into our diplomatic efforts. Abandoning that \nsignals a reversal of decades' worth of work in promoting global gender \nequality.\n  The United States should be taking the lead on fostering an open and \nhonest dialogue about women's issues internationally, not silencing it. \nWe are better than this.\n  Here at home, women have succeeded this past year in taking control \nof the narrative on sexual harassment, and they have forced deaf ears \nto listen. We are witnessing the rise of a new, more equitable social \norder that is built on the raw guts and courage of women who are \nspeaking out to say, ``Me too.''\n  Hearing so many of my fellow Americans--mothers, sisters, wives, \ndaughters, friends--retell and relive some of their most traumatic \nexperiences has been deeply troubling, but it has also been a lesson in \nbravery, in tenacity, and in women's unbreakable spirits.\n  It is that bravery which we must now meet with our own as individuals \nand collectively. If we witness harassment, we must be brave enough to \nintervene. If we are told about abuse, we must be brave enough to take \ndecisive action. If we hear about gender discrimination, we must be \nbrave enough to fight it even when doing so may not be politically \nexpedient or popular. Scores of women have proved their moral strength. \nIt is time for us to demonstrate ours.\n  This Women's History Month, let us take a moment to reflect on the \nthousands and thousands of ``Me Too'' stories that go untold and \nunheard.\n  Let us recognize the single working mother making barely more than \nminimum wage, living paycheck to paycheck, and struggling to turn $5 \ninto a meal for three. When her coworker begins propositioning her, \nthere are no cameras and cable talk shows waiting to expose him. She \nbears the burden alone, often feeling forced to choose between enduring \ndisparaging behavior at work or providing for her children at home.\n  Let us recognize the college graduate working in an office, empowered \nand excited about the direction of her career. Yet, in every meeting, \nher boss undermines her ideas and, one day, when they are alone, \nquestions her suggestively about her method of birth control. Weeks \nlater, his lewd remarks evolve into inappropriate physical contact, and \nhe tells her that if she ever complains, he will ensure she never finds \nanother job in her chosen profession.\n  Let us recognize the immigrant woman working hard at her new job in \nher new home, motivated to become part of the American dream. Her male \ncoworker calls her by disparaging names and suggests openly to their \nsupervisor that she should make less than he does in the event she ever \nbecomes pregnant and costs the company money. She begins to fear both \nfor her job and for herself, but to quit would mean to lose the new \nlife she has so painstakingly built.\n  For an untold number of women, these stories are painfully familiar. \nThe ``Me Too'' movement has proven that sexual harassment and \ndiscrimination know no age and no income level. These experiences are \nfelt by all women of all backgrounds, so it is up to all of us to \ncombat it. Sexual harassment is about power. It is about the harassers \nand authority figures feeling emboldened by being able to behave the \nway they want, wherever they want, with impunity. So let us end the \nsense of impunity.\n  If behavior is about exerting a twisted kind of power, let us arm \nwomen with the most powerful tool in our legal system--the U.S. \nConstitution. Let us finally pass the Equal Rights Amendment. The Equal \nRights Amendment is barely longer than a tweet, but it would finally \ngive women full and equal protection under the Constitution. Section 1 \nof the ERA states, quite simply: ``Equality of rights under the law \nshall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on \naccount of sex.''\n  When Congress proposed the ERA in 1972, it provided that the measure \nhad to be ratified by three-fourths of the States--38 States--within 7 \nyears. This deadline was later extended to 10 years by a joint \nresolution. Ultimately, only 35 out of 38 States had ratified the ERA \nwhen the deadline expired in 1982--three short. Note that the deadline \nwas not contained in the amendment, itself. The deadline was contained \nin a joint resolution.\n  Article V of the Constitution contains no time limits for the \nratification of amendments, so the ERA deadline is arbitrary. To put \nthe matter in context, the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, which \nprohibits congressional pay raises without an intervening election, was \nratified in 1992--203 years after it was first proposed. The Senate \nshould vote to remove the ERA deadline immediately, and every State in \nour Nation that has not yet taken up its consideration should do so \nwithout further delay.\n  Nevada became the 36th State to ratify the amendment last March, \nleaving the ERA only two States short of the required three-fourths of \nthe State threshold under the Constitution if the deadline were to be \nabolished. I think many--perhaps most--Americans\n\n\nwould be shocked to learn that our Constitution has no provision \nexpressly prohibiting gender discrimination.\n  The ERA would incorporate a ban on gender-based discrimination to be \nexplicitly written into the Constitution. It would change outcomes in \nunequal pay cases by requiring the Supreme Court to use the higher \nstandard of ``strict scrutiny'' when assessing those cases--the same \nstandard it uses on racial and religious discrimination cases.\n  Just as importantly, it would provide a constitutional basis for \nclaims of gender-based violence and give the Congress the \nconstitutional basis to pass laws that would give women who have been \nvictimized by gender-based violence legal recourse in Federal courts.\n  In a 2011 interview, the late Justice Antonin Scalia summed up best \nthe need for an Equal Rights Amendment.\n  He said:\n\n       Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination \n     on the basis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits \n     it. It doesn't.\n\n  So I, most sincerely, ask my Senate colleagues this question: Are we \nwilling to do what must be done to prohibit gender discrimination by \nincluding protection against it in the Constitution? Progress has no \nautopilot feature. We must be its agents. We must be its champions. \nWhen we wake up each day to the loud and growing chorus of women saying \n``me too,'' how can we deny them the legal tool as powerful and \nimportant as our own country's Constitution?\n\n  The people being affected by systemic gender inequality are our \nconstituents. They are our wives, our daughters, and our \ngranddaughters. They are American citizens and human beings who deserve \nbasic respect and equality.\n  We are capable of so much more than lip service. We are capable of \ncelebrating Women's History Month by making history. I call on this \nSenate to remove the deadline on passing the Equal Rights Amendment and \nshow the American people we are the leaders they sent us here to be, \nand we will take action. Let us prove that we will use our voices when \nsilence becomes complicity, and we will use our votes when our values \nneed defending.\n  Women deserve to see that their Nation's founding document values \nthem and treats them in a fashion equal to men. They are right to \nexpect that gender equality should be an explicit, basic principle of \nour society. Let us all work together to get this done.\n  Women's rights are human rights, and human rights are not and never \nshould be a partisan issue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Mr. ENZI": ["2018-03-07", "  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, when we debated the Dodd-Frank bill in 2010, \nI concentrated most of my effort on talking about the third portion--\nthe third third of the bill; it is one of those several-hundred page \nbills again--but this was kind of hidden at the end, something called \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, known as the CFPB.\n  I opposed its creation during the debate. I opposed it because it is \nnot a government agency under any way, shape, form, or rule that we \nhave. There is no control whatsoever over this group. The makeup of the \nBureau is quite unique in that a sole Director, rather than a \nbipartisan commission, is the singular decision maker of the agency, \nand it doesn't even require approval by Congress for who that person is \nor the length of their term. Furthermore, the Bureau is not subjected \nto the congressional appropriations process, having guaranteed money \nfrom the Federal Reserve to fund the agency's existence.\n\n  How does that work? Well, they get a percentage of the revenue of the \nFederal Reserve that would normally come to the Federal Government and \nthen be allocated. They get it before it comes to the Federal \nGovernment, so they are outside the control of an appropriations \nprocess. They have guaranteed money. Not only do they have guaranteed \nmoney, they have a guaranteed inflation factor built into their money. \nIt is feasible that with enough inflation, they could control the \nentire revenue from the Federal Reserve. That funding source is more \nassured than Social Security. And if the agency is running amuck, \nCongress has no ability to use the appropriations process to bring \noversight to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That is a great \nname. It seems to protect it, even if that is not primarily what it \nseems to be doing. I am only picking on a very small portion of that \nwith this bill.\n  You may be familiar with something called the transparent General \nSchedule for Federal employees, often referred to as the ``GS scale.'' \nIt is the primary way that the government ensures that Federal employee \nsalaries are appropriate and reasonable. This pay scale, however, \ndoesn't apply to the least accountable agency in the Federal \nGovernment--you guessed it, the CFPB.\n  At the CFPB, the Director has the sole discretion to determine \nemployees' salaries. Government employees at the CFPB--if you want to \ncall them government employees, because they are really outside any \ncontrol by the government, either the executive branch or legislative \nbranch, and it takes a court case to get it to the judicial branch--\ngovernment employees at the CFPB receive some of the highest paychecks \nof all Federal workers. According to data my office obtained from the \nOffice of Personnel Management and the CFPB itself, there were over 170 \nemployees at the CFPB who were paid salaries in 2017 that ranged from \n$180,000 to $259,000. To put this in perspective, in 2017, the highest \npaid appointees in the White House were paid salaries of $179,000--\n$1,000 less than the minimum of these 170 employees at the CFPB. Over \n170 employees at the CFPB receive more pay than the highest paid White \nHouse staffers, and 102 employees of the CFPB make more in annual \nsalary than any of our State Governors. A Supreme Court Justice is paid \nan annual salary of $251,000. Six staff members at the CFPB were paid \nmore than that, and there is no control, so it can go higher. It is \nbased on what the Director approves. In 2017, approximately 47 \nemployees had a salary higher than the Vice President's.\n  It is true that top executives at the big banks can make a hefty \npenny in their industry, but the whole of the American banking industry \ndoesn't see this type of wealth. These are our community bankers and \nour credit unions and institutions that support Main Street America. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average bank employee \nsalary is $63,000. And guess who makes more than these bankers. Their \nregulators, like the CFPB.\n  Last year, Congressman Sean Duffy of Wisconsin and I introduced the \nCFPB Pay Fairness Act to rein in the CFPB's rates of pay. I am offering \nthis bill as an amendment to the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, \nand Consumer Protection Act. The amendment requires the Director of the \nCFPB to set the basic rate of pay in accordance with the GS scale--the \nsame fairness scale that everybody else works under. The GS scale \nprovides information to the public on the credentials of Federal \nemployees, with each level requiring qualification standards, such as \neducation and years of experience.\n  As it stands, the CFPB does not provide any qualification standards \nfor its employees' pay, nor is it transparent to the American people or \neven the CFPB's own employees. This proved to\n\n\nbe an issue when in 2016 the Government Accountability Office \ninvestigated allegations of discrimination at the CFPB. Thirty-three \npercent of the CFPB employee respondents to the GAO--Government \nAccountability Office--indicated they believed their pay was not \ncommensurate with their skills, work experience, and education.\n  Because of the way the CFPB was created in the Dodd-Frank legislation \nthat we are working on right now, Congress failed to impose the usual \nconstitutional checks to rein in this behavior. Congress needs to bring \naccountability to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and we \nshould start with the Bureau's lavish spending on employee salaries. \nThis commonsense amendment would ensure that the Bureau is keeping \nemployees' salaries in line with the regular government pay scale, \nwhich promotes transparency and equity in pay across the Federal \nGovernment.\n  There is a lot more that I could say about this Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, but I want to concentrate on the fact that they are \npaid substantially more than anybody else in government, and we have no \ncontrol over it. There is only one person who does, and that is the one \nwho gets the job as Director--which was taken to court since even the \nPresident can't fire that person, no matter which President it is. So \nthis is just one of the things that make it an unusual organization.\n  From my experience, they aren't doing what they said they would do at \nthe time that they said it needed to be created. Instead, they are \nharassing different businesses until these businesses pay a fine, and \nthat fine goes into a slush fund for them that they can give out to \nones that we would never approve for any money from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  They have this guaranteed revenue. In checking, I find out they are \nsupposed to spend all of it. The Director can set the salaries and has \nvery little firing capability to go along with that. But they are paid \nan inordinate amount compared to everybody else in government, \nincluding Supreme Court Justices, the Vice President, and other people \nwho work around here. The highest paid people at the White House make \n$1,000 less than the lowest paid of these 170 workers.\n  I hope people consider this amendment to bring a degree of fairness \nand transparency so we know what the agency is doing. It is only in the \nway of salaries, but that is a good starting place.\n  I yield the floor."], "Mr. KING": ["2018-03-07", " Mr. KING.

Over the \nyears, the bank has hosted holiday food and gift drives, as well as \nmusical events to raise money for organizations such as the Community \nBicycle Center in Biddeford, ME, and United Way. In January of 2017, \nthe bank sponsored the Atlantic Plunge, a fundraiser hosted by Caring \nUnlimited, in which participants jumped into the ocean to raise \nawareness for and support the end of domestic violence in York County. \nThrough local events and sponsorships, Biddeford Savings Bank promotes \ncommunity engagement for individuals in all financial stages of life. \nFor local\n\n\nstudents, the bank sponsors two programs focused on financial \neducation.

Employees of \nthe bank have also spent time volunteering for local organizations such \nas the Scarborough Land Trust. In celebration of 150 years in business, \nBiddeford Savings Bank gave each of its employees $150 to donate to any \nnonprofit of their choice, including Biddeford Food Pantry and the \nMaine Cancer Foundation. These volunteer opportunities have allowed for \nemployees to better understand the local economic culture and recognize \nconcerns, which allows for them to better serve their customers.\n  With 150 years of banking experience, Biddeford Savings Bank offers a \nvariety of banking options for individuals and businesses with varying \nfinancial needs.

Mr. President, anyone tuning into the Senate floor this \nweek is probably very confused right now, and that is because we are \nnot debating how to address the scourge of gun violence plaguing this \ncountry, just 22 days after the horrific Parkland mass shooting and \nfollowing a near-universal call from the American people for Congress \nto get serious about guns. They are debating it in the State \nlegislature in Florida, but we just don't have time in the U.S. Senate \nto debate this overarching issue of gun safety in our country.\n  The American people may be confused because we are not debating the \nfate of the 800,000 Dreamers and the uncertainty they still face; \nconfused because we are not debating our crumbling infrastructure \nwhich, despite repeated calls from this President, we have seen nothing \nresembling a credible plan from him to fix our Nation's bridges, roads, \nand water systems and provide broadband for rural Americans.\n  Democrats do have a real plan, and we should be debating that. But \nno. Instead, just 3 months after the passage of massive tax giveaways \nthat handed over more than $1 trillion to the wealthiest Americans and \nmegacorporations, we are here debating a giveaway to the world's \nbiggest banks.\n  We have moved on from tax handouts to the wealthy, to taxpayer-funded \nbailouts for Wall Street megabanks. That is not my opinion. The \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released their analysis of this \nbailout bill and noted that the risk of a financial crisis would go up \nunder this legislation.\n  Why in the world is Congress doing anything that increases the risk \nof a financial crisis? It has only been 10 years since the great \nrecession, but Republicans seem to have forgotten about that. Maybe \nthat is why this week is so confusing--because the backers of this bill \nare not talking about the risk to the entire financial system they are \nenabling. They have forgotten that and are only talking about the \nbenefits to community banks.\n  Yes, there are some benefits. Those of us on the other side of this \nlegislation are not arguing about that point. You could probably find \nconsensus among all 100 Senators in this body that there is a \nlegitimate, targeted relief we can and should provide for those \ncommunity banks, but that is far from all this bill does. This \ncommunity bank relief is being used to protect the giveaways for some \nof the biggest banks in this country.\n  Anyone listening to the supporters of this legislation would have no \nidea that 25 of the 38 largest banks in the United States will have \ncritical Dodd-Frank rules rolled back for them. Anyone listening would \nhave no idea that banks with up to $250 billion in assets are being \ntold the current rules are too tough for them. These banks received $48 \nbillion in taxpayer-funded bailout money. Those banks are not community \nbanks.\n  Now, a decade after the financial collapse of 2008, we are saying it \nis probably OK. We are pretty sure they have learned their lessons. We \nare pretty sure that now the big banks will put the economic security \nof the country ahead of their own profits.\n  So the bottom line: This bill, the Economic Growth, Regulatory \nRelief, and Consumer Protection Act, will increase risks to our entire \neconomy, and the fact that the words ``consumer protection'' are \nmentioned last should make clear they are simply an afterthought.\n  When large institutions fail--whether it is Lehman Brothers, Enron, \nAIG--it is everyday working consumers who get hit the hardest and pay \nthe highest price.\n  There is the rule on Wall Street: On the way up, the big guys clean \nup; on the way down, the little guys get cleaned out. We saw that \nduring the last financial crisis, when millions of Americans lost their \njobs or their homes, and we are seeing it today, with increasingly \ncommon data breaches that compromise Americans' financial and personal \ninformation.\n  In recent years, devastating data breaches have become the new \nnormal. The likes of Target, JPMorgan Chase, Yahoo, eBay, T.J.Maxx, \nHome Depot, and Sony are among so many who have become synonymous with \nmassive data breaches.\n  Of course, there is Equifax, which is both a credit reporting agency \nand a data broker. Equifax's sole mission is using and profiting from \nconsumers' most personal information, and they failed to protect that \ninformation. More than 145 million Americans' Social Security numbers, \nbirth dates, addresses, and, in some instances, even driver's license \nnumbers and credit card numbers were compromised because Equifax failed \nto institute even the most basic security protocols. It seems that, for \nthe American consumer, every year is the year of the data breach, and \nthey are sick and tired of their information falling into the wrong \nhands.\n\n\n  So as the Senate debates how to ensure financial institutions do not \nendanger the American economy the way they did during the financial \ncrisis, we cannot forget our constituents' calls for new data \nprotection rules. That is why I have filed my Data Broker \nAccountability and Transparency Act as an amendment to this \nlegislation. I thank Senators Blumenthal, Sanders, and Whitehouse for \njoining me.\n  My colleagues and I--Republican and Democratic alike--were outraged \nwhen we learned about the Equifax hack and how it hurts our \nconstituents across the country, but what have we accomplished in the \nU.S. Senate since then? Nothing, and the threat is only growing.\n  We have an entire industry whose whole business model is predicated \non profiting on Americans' most sensitive information. They are \ncollecting it, storing it, selling it, and, in many instances, losing \nit in data hacks and breaches. Consumers don't even know who these \ncompanies are. They live in the shadows of our economy. Consumers \nrarely have any direct contact or business relationship with a data \nbroker. Yet they know nearly everything about you. That is not just \nSocial Security numbers, detailed credit histories, addresses, driver's \nlicense numbers. That is information on what you read, what music you \nlisten to, your children, and your medical history.\n\n  In today's economy, you--the American consumer--are the commodity \nthat is bought and sold in the open market. Right now, you have no \nrights. Data brokers are collecting, using, sharing Americans' personal \ninformation without your knowledge, without your consent.\n  Right now, American consumers are completely powerless. You can't \nsay: Stop selling my information to any of these companies. That is \nunacceptable.\n  We need transparency; we need accountability. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to support my Data Broker Accountability and Transparency \nAct. My amendment would hold data brokers accountable.\n  First, my amendment allows consumers to access and correct the \ninformation that data brokers hold about them. Americans should be able \nto stop the spread of inaccurate information that could damage them \npersonally and financially.\n  Second, my amendment provides consumers with the right to stop data \nbrokers from using, sharing, or selling their personal information for \nmarketing purposes.\n  Third, my amendment requires data brokers to implement comprehensive \nprivacy and data security programs and to provide reasonable notice in \nthe case of breaches. Equifax should have been required to have robust \nsecurity to protect Americans' information. We must stop the next \nEquifax.\n  It has now been 6 months since the public became aware of that \nbreach, and Congress has yet to enact any major legislation in \nresponse. We are still in the data broker Wild West. American consumers \nare still powerless, and the next breach could be around the corner.\n  Here is the financial services bill that we are taking up. Here is a \nbill that is directly related to these banks that we are talking about. \nHere is an opportunity for us to begin to figure out a way of \nprotecting consumers in this data breach area where their financial \nrecords, where their health records, where their families' records \ncould be compromised.\n  What is the solution? We are moving through legislation that deals \nwith the problems the bankers say they have, but we are not dealing \nwith problems consumers say they have with these financial \ninstitutions. When do we take up that bill? When do we finally say to \nthe largest companies: What are the protections? What are the \nsafeguards that are going to be constructed so that people's personal \ninformation is not compromised, so the data brokers aren't able to \ncreate a world in which everyone's information is just part of their \nprofit-making opportunity?\n  That is what we should be talking about. Let's have a big debate \nhere. Let's ensure that each and every one of these issues is dealt \nwith.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment because we have to get \nto the heart of this Equifax issue. We have to actually deal with the \nworld as it has changed. If the proponents of this bill say that the \nworld has changed since the crash in 2008 and 2009, then the world has \nalso changed with regard to the potential for the compromise of the \ninformation of every American. Let's have that debate, as well, in the \nsame bill.\n  I urge that my amendment be put in order, and I urge that the Members \nof the Senate support it. It is time for us to give those protections \nto consumers, which they are crying out for. No individual consumer is \ncrying out for this change in the banking bill, but they are crying out \nfor protections in a system where they have no voice, no way to ensure \nthat their own family's personal data is not compromised.\n  I yield back to the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Mr. TESTER": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to honor Janet Jones for her \ndistinguished public service to the U.S. Senate.\n  Janet began her Senate career in the Office of the Senate Chief \nCounsel for Employment in 2006 as a litigation paralegal.

With Janet's assistance, \nmany Senate offices, including my own, have earned Safe Office Awards.\n  We will miss Janet's institutional knowledge and unparalleled \nprofessionalism.\n  Janet, thank you for your service, and I wish you great happiness in \nretirement.\n"], "Mr. SANDERS": ["2018-01-18", "  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, we are at a pivotal moment. If the \nCongress does not get its act together by tomorrow, there will be a \ngovernment shutdown. A government shutdown will be extraordinarily \ndestructive to the people of our country, millions of whom depend upon \ngovernment services. It will be destructive to millions of Federal \nemployees who keep their families going with a paycheck from the \ngovernment. It will be destructive to the U.S. Armed Forces, men and \nwomen who put their lives on the line to defend us. So it seems to me \nthat we have to do everything we can to prevent a government shutdown.\n  As everyone knows, we have a Republican Party that controls the U.S. \nSenate, a Republican Party that controls the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and a Republican who is in the White House, President \nTrump. We are now 3\\1/2\\ months into the fiscal year, and the \nRepublican Party has yet to give us an annual budget.\n  The U.S. Government is a $3 trillion operation. There is no business \nin this country of any size that can run week to week, month to month. \nWe need an annual budget, and now the Republicans are coming back, \nasking for a fourth continuing resolution. You cannot run a government \nlike that. It is unfair to the American people, unfair to the Armed \nForces, unfair to all of us.\n  Three and a half months have gone in the fiscal year; yet the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program has not been reauthorized. This is \na program that has existed for decades with bipartisan support. How can \nwe not reauthorize the CHIP Program?\n  Three and a half months of the fiscal year have come and gone, and we \nhave not reauthorized the Community Health Center Program, which \nprovides primary healthcare, dental care, mental health counseling, \nlow-cost prescription drugs to 27 million Americans\n\n\nin every State in this country. If legislation were brought to the \nfloor of the Senate today, the Blunt-Stabenow bill reauthorizing the \ncommunity health centers, I suspect, would get 70, 75 votes; yet \nRepublicans, after 3\\1/2\\ months, have not been able to reauthorize the \nCHIP Program or the Community Health Center Program.\n  When we talk about the budget process, we are talking about three \nmajor issues; there are more, but there are three major issues. No. 1, \nwill we continue to have parity in spending between defense spending \nand nondefense spending? Since 2011, in four different budgets, there \nhas been a bipartisan agreement that for every dollar spent on defense \nis a dollar you will spend on the needs of a struggling middle class, \nmillions of people who are struggling every day to keep their heads \nabove water economically--a dollar here, a dollar there. That has been \nagreed upon on four separate occasions, but several weeks ago, the \nRepublican leader, Senator McConnell, came to the floor and said: We \nwant to do away with that parity. We want to be able to spend more on \nthe military and less on the needs of working families.\n  We have a middle class that is shrinking. We have people all over \nthis country working two or three jobs. We have the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty of almost any other major country on Earth. We have \nmillions of elderly people who can't make it on $12,000 or $13,000 a \nyear. We have a crisis sweeping the Nation, hitting my State of Vermont \nvery hard. We have infrastructure that is crumbling. We cannot ignore \nthe needs of the working families of this country and spend huge \namounts of money only on the military.\n  Some of the things we have to do as we come together, as we must, for \na bipartisan agreement is, of course, reauthorize CHIP and, of course, \nreauthorize the Community Health Center Program. The Stabenow-Blunt \nbill has nine Republican cosponsors. Every Democrat will support it. We \nhave the votes. Let's do it.\n  We have to deal with the pension issue. One and a half million \nAmerican workers are about to lose 50 to 60 percent of the pensions \nthey were promised by the U.S. Government. That cannot be allowed to \nhappen. We have to stand with those workers.\n  I went to a meeting earlier today dealing with the Social Security \nAdministration. The Social Security Administration provides a process--\nthe administrative arm makes sure that the elderly, disabled, and \npeople who get Social Security benefits get those benefits in a timely \nmanner. For years now, Republicans have underfunded that \nadministration, and today there are simply not enough employees to do \nthe work that has to be done. Amazingly enough, over at the House they \nare talking about massive cuts to the Social Security Administration on \ntop of all the cuts they have already received.\n  The Washington Post wrote an article a few weeks ago--unbelievable--\nand what they said is that over the last year, if you can believe it, \n10,000 people with disabilities who had applied for Social Security \nbenefits died while waiting for those claims to be processed. They were \nnot processed in a timely manner because the Social Security \nAdministration does not have the workers it needs and has been \nsignificantly underfunded. For the sake of the senior citizens of our \ncountry, for the sake of the disabled, any budget agreement when we \nhave parity must supply sufficient amounts of money for the Social \nSecurity Administration so that they can do their work.\n\n  Every Veterans Day, every Member of this body talks about how much \nthey love veterans. The Veterans' Administration today has 30,000 \nvacancies, which means that our veterans are not getting the quality \nand timely care that they must be able to receive. We have to start \nfilling those vacancies. Any budget agreement must include increased \nfunding for the VA.\n  In my State of Vermont and all over this country, there are millions \nof young people who went to college, went to graduate school, and have \nleft school deeply in debt. Because of high interest rates, some of \nthose people now owe more money today after paying off, year after \nyear, their debts than they did when they took out the debt. We have to \naddress the debt crisis facing some 40 million Americans.\n  In Vermont and all over this country, if you are a working person, \nwhat do you do if you have a 3-year-old or a 2-year-old? Well, you look \nfor decent, quality childcare. But all over this country it is \nextremely difficult to find that quality childcare. Any serious budget \nagreement we reach must include increased funding for childcare so that \nworking people in this country know, when they leave their kid at a \ncenter, that child will receive quality care at a cost that is \naffordable. Every dollar we invest in early childhood education is a \ndollar very, very well spent.\n  All over this country, in this, the wealthiest Nation in the history \nof the world, we have infrastructure--roads, bridges, water systems, \nwaste water plants--which is crumbling. In many parts of rural America, \nincluding the State of Vermont, we do not have high-quality, affordable \nbroadband or cell phone service. How do you maintain a community, how \ndo you bring business into a community, how do kids do their homework \nif you don't have decent broadband or cell phone service? We have to \ninvest in rural America and make certain that every community in this \ncountry has broadband and the kind of infrastructure that it needs in \norder to prosper.\n  One of the tragedies taking place in this country today is resulting, \nunbelievably, in a lowered life expectancy rate here in the United \nStates of America. Our life expectancy rate is actually in decline, and \none of the reasons for that is the tragic opioid and heroin epidemic, \nwhich claimed some 60,000 lives last year. We cannot ignore that \nproblem. We have to invest in prevention. We have to invest in \ntreatment. We have to help States all over this country and the \nfamilies who are struggling with this issue.\n  My point is, we need parity, not for some abstract, inside-the-\nbeltway reason; we need parity in spending because we need more in this \ncountry than just a strong military. We need a strong middle class. We \nneed a strong working class. We cannot turn our backs on tens of \nmillions of people who are struggling.\n  The second issue that we have to deal with here in the Congress is \nthe issue of DACA and the need for clean Dreamers legislation. In \nSeptember, President Trump initiated a very serious crisis. What he did \nis rescind President Obama's Executive order providing legal status \nthrough DACA to 800,000 young people. These are young people who were \nraised in the United States of America. These are young people who \ntoday are working. They are in school; they are in the military. This \nis the only home they have ever known. This is the only country that \nany of them or many of them can even remember. The idea of simply doing \naway with the legal status that they have, subjecting them to \ndeportation, subjecting them to being taken away from the only country \nthey have ever known and loved is literally beyond comprehension and \nunspeakable.\n  In September, when Trump initiated this process by rescinding Obama's \nExecutive order on DACA, he said to the Congress, the Republican \nleadership in the House and Senate: You fix it. Get legislation.\n  Well, there are people right now--Senator Durbin, Senator Graham, and \nothers--who are working on legislation, which doesn't go as far as I \nwould like it to go, but they are working on serious legislation in the \nHouse. The vast majority of Democrats and many Republicans understand \nthat we cannot turn our backs on these young people. That is not just \nwhat we feel here in the House and in the Senate; it is what the \nAmerican people want. Poll after poll shows that 70, 75, 80 percent of \nthe American people say: Provide these 800,000 young people with legal \nstatus. Provide them with a path toward citizenship. Very few people \nthink that we should turn our backs on these young people, let DACA \nexpire, and subject them to deportation. Let us do what the American \npeople want us to do, and let us pass a strong Dreamers Act.\n  Last but not least, we had some terrible hurricanes some months ago. \nThey brought a lot of disaster to Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the \nVirgin Islands. Months have gone by, and we have yet to pass the kind \nof disaster relief that communities in those States and territories \ndesperately need.\n  We cannot continue to kick the can down the road. We cannot continue \nto\n\n\nrun a $3 trillion government on a month-by-month basis. It is unfair to \neverybody. We have to sit down and negotiate a serious budget \nagreement. And what Republicans must understand is that, yes, they have \na 51-to-49 majority here in the Senate, but you need 60 votes to pass \nthis type of legislation. You need 60 votes, and that means you cannot \ndo it alone. You cannot give the Democratic caucus a fait accompli and \nexpect Democrats to say: Oh, yes, sir, we are going to follow you. This \nrequires bipartisan discussion on the parity issue and domestic \nspending and bipartisan discussion on DACA.\n  We have a strong majority of Members of the Senate who support a \nDreamers piece of legislation and a path toward citizenship. We have a \nstrong majority of the American people and a strong majority of Members \nof the Senate who want disaster relief. This should not be a difficult \nproblem. The American people want a resolution, and they want it done \nin a bipartisan way. Let's do it. Let's not kick the can down the road. \nRepublicans must understand that they must negotiate in a bipartisan \nway.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Mr. THUNE": ["2018-02-26", " Mr. THUNE.

The Senator from Hawaii.\n"], "Ms. STABENOW": ["2018-02-15", "  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we have so many issues in front of us \nthat are critically important to families. I want to speak about an \nissue today that is extremely important to so many Michigan families \nand to families across the Nation.\n  It is estimated that 5.5 million Americans are living with \nAlzheimer's disease, including 1 out of 10 people over the age of 65. \nThat number is growing. To put that in perspective, that is about the \nsame number of people who live in Wisconsin or Minnesota or Colorado.\n  By 2050, it is estimated that as many as 16 million Americans may be \nliving with Alzheimer's. That is more people than live in Pennsylvania \nor Illinois. From Alaska to Alabama, to New Mexico, to Maine, no State \nis immune, as we know. In my own State of Michigan, the number of \npeople living with Alzheimer's disease is expected to rise from about \n180,000 today to 220,000 in the year 2025, which is not very far away. \nThat is an increase of about 22 percent in less than 7 years.\n  The cost of providing healthcare and long-term care for people \naffected by Alzheimer's is astronomical and growing. In fact, one out \nof every five Medicare dollars goes to Alzheimer's disease. It is \nestimated that last year, for the first time, the United States spent \nmore than a quarter of a trillion dollars on Alzheimer's-related care. \nWithout better treatments or a cure, those costs could surpass $1.1 \ntrillion by 2050.\n  Of course, much higher than the dollar cost is the human cost. As \nanyone who has lived with the disease or anyone who has had a family \nmember live with the disease can tell you--and this really is the \nultimate family disease--Alzheimer's and related dementias are thieves. \nThey steal everything--memories, personalities, even lives. No price \ntag could ever be put on the suffering they cause patients and their \nfamilies and the strain they place on caregivers.\n  There are 15 million people in the United States caring for a family \nmember with Alzheimer's. While many of them consider caring for a loved \none a sacred duty, this duty still exacts a physical and mental toll on \nthem. Caregivers suffer higher rates of heart disease, cancer, and \ndepression than those in the broader population, and many are forced to \nquit their jobs or reduce the hours they work, creating additional \npersonal and financial stresses.\n  Lauren Kovach of Brighton, MI, learned what that is like when her \ngrandma--she calls her Chupe--was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Lauren's \nmom was a caregiver. She and Lauren made a pact that they would never \nput Chupe in a nursing home because she, in Lauren's words, ``lived her \nlife for her family and to take care of us--of course we were going to \ndo the same for her.''\n  That required a lot of sacrifices. Lauren's mom retired early. Lauren \nwithdrew from college and moved in with her mom to provide a ``loving \nhome full of laughter,'' as she said. They received no help with \ncaregiving or living expenses. Lauren wrote:\n\n       My mom is single-handedly the best person I know. She needs \n     help. We need help. Many hundreds of families like mine need \n     help.\n\n  Lauren's beloved grandma passed away last June, but Lauren is still \nfighting, and I am proud to be fighting alongside her. She wrote:\n\n       I go to Lansing each year for Advocacy Day--I will talk to \n     anyone and everyone about this disease that is ruining \n     millions of lives, including mine. Alzheimer's unfortunately \n     isn't going anywhere anytime soon, but neither am I.\n\n  This fighting spirit is what keeps caregivers like Lauren going, and \nthey deserve to know that we are, in fact, fighting alongside them. \nThat is why Senator Capito and I have introduced legislation that will \nhelp give families in West Virginia, Michigan, and all across the \ncountry new tools to cope with an Alzheimer's diagnosis and the life \nthat follows.\n  I would like to thank my friend from West Virginia for partnering \nwith me on this important bill. The CHANGE Act builds on my HOPE for \nAlzheimer's Act, which was implemented beginning last year and supports \nparents and their families by requiring Medicare to pay for an \nindividual care plan when a family member is diagnosed. This encourages \nmore doctors to feel there is a reason to have early diagnosis because \nthere is something they can do for people. It is certainly something \nthat families need in order to have a plan, an action plan, once they \nreceive that diagnosis.\n  The CHANGE Act approaches this disease from a number of different \ndirections and builds on the HOPE for Alzheimer's Act.\n  First, it encourages early assessment and diagnosis. This is not \nhappening as much as we would like. The Alzheimer's Association polling \nhas indicated that a very high number--35 percent to 40 percent--of \nphysicians are not doing early diagnosis. Oftentimes, they have said it \nis because they don't know what to do about it. There is no cure. There \nis not something to offer families other than fear.\n  We want to make sure there is early diagnosis because there is a lot \ngoing on right now with medications that actually will help early. We \nwant to make sure that patients have more time to make their own \nhealthcare decisions, to access community-based support services for \ntheir family truly to be able to plan. Through HOPE for Alzheimer's, we \nnow have a caregiving plan that the physician will be reimbursed for \ncoordinating and bringing together. But there is much more that we need \nto do.\n  Early diagnosis also gives patients and their families additional \nopportunities to participate in clinical trials. There is great \nresearch going on in Michigan and across the country that really does \nprovide hope.\n  I am encouraged and hopeful about the additional dollars we just \nagreed to in the budget agreement last week. I was proud to be one of \nthose pushing for additional research dollars for the National \nInstitutes of Health. Hopefully, those opportunities and cures will \ncome even faster.\n  Second, the CHANGE Act would improve care by testing what types of \nprograms most help patients, their\n\n\nfamilies, and caregivers. We know that case management, coordination of \ncare, and caregiver support services can make a big difference both in \nthe quality of life for patients and caregivers and in participation in \nclinical trials.\n  In addition, the CHANGE Act would offer States the opportunity to \ntest programs that help Alzheimer's patients to remain in the \ncommunity--which is so important--by reducing the financial burden on \nfamily caregivers.\n  Finally, the CHANGE Act would help uncover regulatory and legislative \nchanges that would help accelerate Alzheimer's disease research, which \nis so critical right now. Families in Michigan and across the country \nhave been waiting long enough. They have been waiting too long. They \nneed a cure. Until that day comes, they need better treatments and more \nsupport.\n  Just ask Nora Ann Reid-LeZotte of Kalamazoo. Only a few months after \nher father's death, her mom started to show signs of Alzheimer's. Nora \nAnn was determined to care for her mom at home. Given that she is a \nnurse practitioner, Nora Ann figured she was perfectly prepared to \nassume the role of caregiver--and then, she says, she wasn't.\n  ``My days, then weeks, then years became more overwhelming than I \ncould have imagined,'' Nora Ann said of the 6 years she spent \ncaregiving. Nora Ann and her husband moved in with her mom to care for \nher and rented out their own house to make ends meet. Caregiver support \nwould have made a huge difference, Nora Ann said, yet none was \navailable until her mom's condition deteriorated enough that she needed \nIV infusions to stay hydrated.\n  Nora Ann said:\n\n       I was exhausted. I lost my own identity, my friends, and my \n     life for that timeframe. My family suffered and sacrificed so \n     I could care for my mom with dignity and safety.\n\n  She added:\n\n       I would do it all again because she was my mom.\n\n  I can certainly identify with that, as I know all of us can. Nora Ann \nput her own life on hold to make her mom's final years as comfortable \nas possible. People like Nora Ann deserve our praise. Even more than \nthat, they deserve our support and action on their behalf.\n  It is time for a change. Let's pass this legislation as quickly as \npossible to help patients, support caregivers, and find better \ntreatments and a cure. Families across Michigan and the country are \nwaiting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Mr. SCOTT": ["2018-02-07", "  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, 6 weeks after the passage of tax reform, we \ncontinue to show the American people how we are delivering on our \npromises with real, lasting tax reform.\n  In fact, a recent poll showed that 69 percent of Americans are \nsatisfied with the boost in our economy. Another poll showed that \nAmericans' approval of our tax reform package has more than doubled \nsince its passage. I know it will continue to rise as more families see \nthe benefits coming their way. Our new tax law will ensure that they \nare able to keep more of their paychecks and that the jobs of the \nfuture are created right here in the good old U.S.A.\n\n\n  Back home in South Carolina, we continue to see positive changes \nbecause of tax reform. More businesses are awarding their employees \nwith raises, and as a result, more families are putting more money in \ntheir bank accounts and in their pockets.\n  Here is a real-life example. I received a note from Steve Potts, the \nCEO of Scout Boats in Summerville, SC. Scout Boats is, for those who \nmay not know--but everybody knows Scout Boats--Scout Boats is a world-\nclass brand. It has been recognized all over the world for quality \nboats. Here is a success story, an organic success story.\n  Back in 1989, Steve started his business with his wife in their \ngarage. They did very well for a while, and then, of course, very \nquickly, Hurricane Hugo came about several months later and wiped them \nout. They had to start all over again.\n  They had two employees in 1989. Their life savings were invested into \nScout Boats. Today, almost 30 years later, they have 340 employees. \nThis year, they are going to hand out $1,000 bonuses to their 340 \nemployees, and they hope this is the year that they will take their \nemployees from 340 to 350 and exceed 400 employees.\n  He said:\n\n       We're confident this will help--\n\n  The tax reform package.\n\n     --further stimulate our own company morale, as well as become \n     an attractive career opportunity for new employees we are \n     currently searching for. . . . We believe by us giving back \n     to our employees, we're doing exactly what you and many \n     others originally intended with tax reform.\n\n  This is fantastic news and proof that we are reaching our goals.\n  I want to say thank you to Steve, not only for sharing your story but \nfor rewarding the hard work of your employees. It is what happens in \nsmall and medium businesses all over the country.\n  Having started a small business myself, I understand and appreciate \nthe dedication Steve had to his vision and to his employees, because \nfor Steve and so many entrepreneurs, their employees are an extension \nof their family. So being in a position to provide those folks with a \n$1,000 bonus each is a big deal. It is a big deal for the company. It \nis a big deal for the employees. It is reflective of the fact that most \nsmall businesses are reinvesting in their future, which means \nreinvesting in their employees. Steve is a classic example.\n  Just like Steve, in the last 6 weeks, more than 3 million Americans \nhave seen direct benefits from tax reform, be it bonuses or wage \nincreases or better benefits. It is all good news, and it just keeps on \ncoming. It is good news. More than 300 companies across our great \nNation have announced significant benefits for their employees.\n  There is more. My Investing in Opportunity Act was included in the \ntax cut, and it is designed to help 52 million Americans living in \ndistressed communities like the very one in which I grew up. We have \nworked hard to get the IIOA--Investing in Opportunity Act--across the \nfinish line so that it can be deployed in States around this Nation to \nhelp those very folks. That means everything from workforce investment, \nto better education, to businesses being attracted into these \nopportunity zones.\n  I want to thank the majority leader for his words on the Investing in \nOpportunity Act yesterday morning. He is right. This will empower \ncommunities, and it will put up a big neon sign that says we are open \nfor business. It will help communities that today may be wavering, \nquestioning whether they can be successful. This is a resounding yes. \nYes, you should be hopeful. Yes, you can be successful.\n\n  I know these communities full well, and they are full of folks \nlooking for a chance, an opportunity to put their creativity, their \nintelligence, and their work ethic on display. The Investing in \nOpportunity Act will provide that chance.\n  The benefits of tax reform have just begun. Whether it is bonuses for \nworkers, more wages, better benefits, or the implementation of the \nInvesting in Opportunity Act, we know that the best is yet to come for \nthe American people.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Ms. MURKOWSKI": ["2018-03-07", "  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and congratulate \nhim. I recognize him and Senator Crapo, as well, for their efforts.\n  I think, as we look to those energy solutions that can take our \ncountry and our planet to a place that is better, that demonstrate a \ntruly greater environmental stewardship through the uses of clean \nenergy, one should almost immediately look to the benefits that nuclear \nis able to provide for us.\n  In my coming from a fossil-producing State like Alaska, people often \nask, if I were not someone in Congress, would I be a supporter of \nnuclear. I truly believe that when it comes to our energy portfolio and \nthose that will allow us to have a balanced approach to our energy and \nour energy solutions and when we are talking about the affordability, \nthe accessibility, the diversity of supply, and the security of supply, \nyou must also include and emphasize the clean energy supply.\n  What the Senator from Rhode Island continues to repeat is worth \nrepeating. Focusing on how we move ourselves to a cleaner energy \nenvironment is something we have had opportunities to visit and is \nsomething to which I am committed. So I look forward to finding those \nareas of balance.\n\n\n                        Remembering Jim Balamaci\n\n  Mr. President, I am here this afternoon for a brief few moments to \npay tribute to an Alaskan whom we lost just within the past 2 weeks.\n  My State is a State that is well known for the strength of its \nnonprofit sector, and we lost one of our leaders of that sector--a very \nspecial person who was beloved by many. He was a gentleman, a friend, \nby the name of Jim Balamaci. Jim was the president and chief executive \nofficer of Alaska's Special Olympics. He unexpectedly passed away at \nthe age of 63.\n  This Sunday, I will be going home and will join with thousands who \nwill fill the Alaska Airlines Arena on the University of Alaska \nAnchorage campus to pay tribute to Jim and to celebrate his \ncontributions to the Special Olympics. Jim was really a giant in the \nSpecial Olympics, both at the local level and at the national level.\n  I think it is most fitting that the celebration of Jim's life will \noccur during the weekend of the Special Olympics Alaska Winter Games. \nThis will provide an opportunity for the many Special Olympians, the \ncoaches, the volunteers--I am actually going to be there to help pass \nout awards--and for so many of us whose lives have been touched by \nJim's inspiration to gather together to show our love and our \nadmiration for, again, a truly great man.\n  Being born in Alaska affords one a certain quantum of bragging rights \nwhen it comes to leadership, but truth be told, when the history of \nAlaska post-statehood is written, it is people like Jim who came from \nsomewhere else and chose to make Alaska their home--their lives will be \nremembered for making Alaska the extraordinary and very special place \nthat it is. Jim really fit that bill.\n  Our NBC affiliate in Anchorage, KTUU, said: ``If there was ever an \nAlaskan who wore his heart on his sleeve, it was Balamaci.''\n  In a 2017 interview with KTUU, Jim explained what makes Alaska so \nspecial in words that show how significant a figure he will be \nremembered as. He said: ``We build our communities, we build our state, \nand we build our friendships.'' That in a nutshell really explains the \nDNA of post-statehood Alaska. Jim absolutely got it, and I think that \nis one of the reasons he has earned a place in history, as well as in \nour hearts.\n  Jim was born in Bridgeport, CT. He was active in sports. He was \nactive in church. He entered a pretheology program at St. Vladimir's \nOrthodox Theological Seminary in Yonkers, NY. He was concurrently a \nstudent at Iona College in nearby New Rochelle. He graduated from Iona \nin 1976.\n  A year after graduation, Jim left the suburbs of New York City to \npursue his Alaskan adventure, his Alaskan dream. He moved north. He \nsettled in Kodiak--pretty remote, not on anybody's road system. He \nworked in commercial fisheries there. He was a carpenter and teacher, \nand he kind of did it all. That is when he began his career, his \nlifetime of volunteer service.\n  He began volunteering in the Special Olympics in 1979, and shortly \nthereafter, he moved into coaching. He was selected as president and \nCEO of Special Olympics in Alaska in 1996. Back in 1996, there were \nabout 400 athletes around the State. Jim grew that universe of athletes \nof Special Olympians. Alaska's Special Olympics community today \nincludes some 2,000 athletes, and I can tell you, they are all friends \nof Jim's.\n  In a career as rich as Jim's, it might be difficult to identify just \none or two experiences that were truly exceptional, but I would bet \nthat Jim would probably say that he was most proud of the 2001 Special \nOlympics World Winter Games that were hosted in Alaska. We had over \n3,000 athletes from 80 countries who participated in the event. Eunice \nKennedy Shriver, who, of course, is the founder of the Special \nOlympics, reportedly told Jim that it was the best World Winter Games \nin Special Olympics' history. That was substantial praise from the \nfounder of the Special Olympics.\n  Up until the last visit I had with Jim here in Washington, DC, Tim \nShriver, who is also an extraordinary individual working within the \nSpecial Olympics, has been there with Jim when they come to Washington \nto visit with me.\n  Another capstone experience occurred in 2014 with the completion of \nthe Special Olympics Alaska Athlete Training Center and Campus. I will \ntell you, this is a phenomenal facility. It is really a one-of-a-kind \nfacility. It is 28,000 square feet. It has a facility center, an indoor \ntrack, and a multipurpose sports court. It has a kitchen where the \nathletes learn about nutrition. It was built at a cost of about $7 \nmillion. It remains one of the world's only dedicated training centers \nfor developmentally disabled athletes. I have had occasion several \ntimes a year to be able to go out to their games. They have field \nhockey inside. The games they are able to participate in year-round in \na place like Alaska--to have this training facility is absolutely \nexceptional and unparalleled.\n  When we think of the Special Olympians, we typically tend to think of \nyounger athletes, but as young Special Olympians age, they still remain \nSpecial Olympians. Jim saw this. We had so many conversations where he \nwas talked about just the demographic, the aging population that we are \nseeing among our Special Olympians and those who are developmentally \ndisabled. He said that we cannot not be thinking about their future as \nwell.\n  Jim was truly a pioneer. He worked in developing the Aging Unified \nAthlete Program with Special Olympics leaders across the country to \nensure that developmentally disabled athletes live long and healthy \nlives, focusing on lifetime learning but really making sure that at all \nages, there is engagement.\n  Jim had an extraordinary heart, a big heart, a warm personality. He \nwas just so loved. I cannot convey it enough. He was loved by not only \nthose within the community of the Special Olympics but within the \nbroader Alaskan community at large. I certainly saw that this fall when \nthe torch run was being put on, which is a partnership with our law \nenforcement, along with our Special Olympians--again, a coming together \nof a community to provide support for one another.\n  Jim could motivate and charm with the best of them. You need look no \nfurther for evidence of that than to be out at a place called Goose \nLake in Anchorage, AK, the third week of December. Jim Balamaci is a \nguy who could\n\n\nget thousands of Alaskans--literally thousands of Alaskans--to jump \ninto a hole in a frozen lake in December to raise money for the Special \nOlympics.\n  If you have never dressed up in costume to jump into a hole--this is \nnot something where you can wade out to get your feet wet and say: I \nhave done the polar plunge. This is a polar plunge where you go into \nthat hole and you are swimming in a frozen lake, and it is December. I \nwas out there in December. Jim Balamaci reminded us that we were all \nthere ``freezin' for a reason,'' and that reason was to help the \nSpecial Olympics and Special Olympians. He was an extraordinarily \nspecial person to so many of us.\n  On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I send my condolences to Jim's \nmother Frusina. She visited him often during his 40-year Alaskan \nadventure. We send our condolences to his sister and brother and to all \nthose who were touched by Jim's kindness and generosity.\n  Alaska and our Special Olympians across the country are better \nbecause of Jim Balamaci.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Young)": ["2018-02-26", "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Young).

Mr. President, I rise tonight to join my colleagues in \nspeaking to the need to immediately\n\n\nrespond to Russian interference. I would like to thank Senator \nWhitehouse for bringing us together.\n  This evening, many of my colleagues have spoken about how Russian \naggression affects Americans and our allies across the world. Some have \ndiscussed the need for sanctions to defer Russia and the fact that the \nadministration has not yet imposed sanctions, the same sanctions that \nwere passed by the Senate 98 to 2 and 419 to 3 in the House of \nRepresentatives. Those were the additional sanctions that were directly \nrelated to the interference in the elections and what we saw take place \nover the last year. They sit dormant.\n\n  Others have talked about the importance of Special Counsel Mueller's \ninvestigation and the fact that it must move forward without \ninterference from the White House. Nearly a dozen Senators have come to \nthe floor to highlight the need to stand up to Russia. I am here to \ntalk about the critical need to safeguard the most fundamental part of \nour democracy--the U.S. elections.\n  Today, I heard the Prime Minister of Sweden address our Nation. When \nstanding next to the President, he was asked a question about this, and \nhe put it simply. He said that in their country, they believe that the \npeople, the citizens of their country, should be the ones who make the \ndecisions about their elections, that they are the ones who should be \nable to vote, that they are the ones who should be able to have their \nown opinions not be influenced by foreign countries acting as if they \nare people in their country.\n  It is the Presiding Officer who made the statement that I have quoted \nso many times--that in the last election, it was one candidate and one \nparty, and in the next election, it could be the other candidate and \nthe other party. We do not come here in a partisan way. We come here \nbecause the clock is ticking.\n  Today marks an important day in the 2018 election cycle. Texas is \nholding the first State primary, and others begin in the coming weeks, \nincluding in Illinois. Illinois was one of 21 States that the Russians \nattempted to hack into--Illinois, where they actually hacked into their \nvoter data, which is the personal information about their voters. Those \nelections are coming. We are glad that we have a decentralized system \nso that they have different systems. It is easier to hack into one \ncentralized system. It also means that they have many things to choose \nfrom, and we have 40 States that haven't updated their equipment in \nover 10 years. We have 10 States that don't even have backup paper \nballots, and we sit here doing nothing when the solution is right in \nfront of us.\n  Over the course of the last year, I have come to the floor a number \nof times to urge this body to take immediate action to beef up our \nelection cybersecurity. There is no longer any doubt that our elections \nhave been and will continue to be a target for foreign adversaries. \nIntelligence reports make it clear that Russia used covert cyber \nattacks, espionage, and harmful propaganda to attack our political \nsystem.\n  I mentioned the attempts on 21 State election systems. Do you know \nwhen the real election--the general election--is? It is 245 days away, \nwith primaries beginning today. We have not imposed the sanctions--the \nadministration hasn't--despite this body's taking firm action that we \nwanted to see these sanctions imposed.\n  We have had six security heads from this administration--not from the \nObama administration; they already spoke out on this. The head of the \nCIA, the Director of National Intelligence, and the head of the FBI \nhave all testified before U.S. Senate committees that, in fact, this is \nhappening now. It was Director Coats, who was once a Senator here, who \nsaid that, in fact, he believes the Russians are getting bolder. These \nare not the words of Obama's security people. These are the words of \nTrump's security people.\n  Last week, NSA Director Rogers said this about Russia: ``They haven't \npaid a price at least that is sufficient to get them to change their \nbehavior.''\n  Earlier this year, CIA Director Pompeo said that he has seen no signs \nthat Russia has decreased its activity and that Russia is currently \nworking to disrupt the upcoming 2018 elections.\n  It is the policy of the United States of America to defend against \nand respond to threats to our Nation. This is a cyber attack. It is not \nwith bullets, and it is not with tanks. It is not with aircraft, but it \nis an attack. It is, simply, using the computer system. In every \nbriefing that I have gone to, this is always listed as one of the major \nways in which foreign adversaries are going to attack our Nation--they \nare going to use the internet. Here we have it happening right here on \nour very democracy, itself.\n  In order to protect our election system, we need to do three key \nthings.\n  First, we must give State and local officials the tools and resources \nthey need to prevent hacks and safeguard election infrastructure from \nforeign interference. They need those resources now, not after the \nelection, not after the primaries. Today, more than 40 States, as I \nmentioned, rely on electronic voting systems that are at least 10 years \nold. Do you think the Russians don't know that? Do you think I am \ngiving away some state secret here? Of course they know that.\n  Ten years ago, on February 6, 2008, it was Super Tuesday for the 2008 \nPresidential election. A lot has changed in the last 10 years but not \nour voting equipment. It has remained the same. That is why I am \nleading bipartisan legislation with Senator Lankford. This is a \nbipartisan effort. We also appreciate our cosponsors Senators Harris, \nGraham, Collins, and Heinrich. We call this bill the Secure Elections \nAct. It would provide $386 million in grant funding for States to \nsecure their elections systems. It is paid for. We found a pay-for.\n  We have a similar bill that is led by Congressman Meadows in the \nHouse--the head of the Freedom Caucus--because they understand that \nfreedom is not cheap, that to guarantee freedom, you must have a secure \ndemocracy, and $386 million is just 3 percent of the cost of one \naircraft carrier.\n  I think most Americans would agree that, as we see more and more \nsophisticated types of warfare happening, to not even pay attention to \nhelping the States fund this election equipment that has been woefully \nunderfunded is a huge mistake.\n  The second thing that we need to do--by the way we can do this now. \nWe can do this in the omnibus bill. The second thing we need to do is \nimprove information sharing so that local election officials know when \nthey are attacked and how to respond. It took the Federal Government \nnearly a year to notify these 21 States that were targeted by Russian-\nbacked hackers. That cannot happen again.\n  Finally, we need a reliable backup system. I am talking about paper \nbackup ballots--the old-fashioned way. There are 10 States that don't \nhave them.\n  The integrity of our election system is the cornerstone of our \ndemocracy. Americans have fought and died for our democracy since our \ncountry was founded, and we must guarantee that democracy continues.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor."], "Mr. RUBIO": ["2018-02-15", "  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I join my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Florida, with a broken heart, as does most of the Nation due to \nthe events of yesterday.\n  There, indeed, was a time in the history of our country where after \nan event such as this there was a mourning period that followed with a \npolicy debate, but today, that time is interrelated and intermixed. I \ndon't blame it. I am not upset about it. In fact, I think there have \nbeen too many of\n\n\nthese events now. That is why we continue to face it.\n  I think it is legitimate to say that even as we mourn, we have an \nobligation to ask ourselves, Is there something we could have done or \nshould do to ensure that we don't see these things happening?\n  It is cliche to say, but I think it is important to say: I am the \nfather of two young ladies who happen to be in high school. I cannot \nimagine, but I can only envision, what it would be like if one day \nwalking through the Capitol I get a text or one of those news alerts \nthat says there has been a shooting in the high school they attend. I \ncan only imagine how fearful it would be when suddenly those texts are \nnot being answered, and those calls are not being returned. I thought \nabout that last night and what it must feel like to be one of those \nparents at the hotel waiting for word because you hadn't heard from \nyour children in hours or how painful it must have been for those whose \njob it was to go to these parents and inform them that their child's \nlife--whom they had sent off to school in the morning, perhaps just \nweeks away from graduation--had ended senselessly in an event such as \nthis. Because of what happened yesterday and because it is happening so \noften, people from across the political spectrum are arguing, there has \nto be something we can do; you have to be able to do something.\n  I agree with that sentiment. I understand it. I would add, though, \nthat if we do something, it should be something that works. The \nstruggle up to this point has been that most of the proposals that have \nbeen offered would not have prevented not just yesterday's tragedy but \nany of those in recent history.\n  I am going to say now what I am going to really emphasize at the end. \nJust because these proposals would not have prevented these events does \nnot mean we raise our hands and say, therefore, there is nothing we can \ndo. It is a tough issue. Part of the reason it is so hard to prevent \nthese events is because if someone decides they are going to take it \nupon themselves to kill people, whether it is a political assassination \nof one person or the mass killing of many, if one person decides to do \nit, and they are committed to that task, it is a very difficult thing \nto stop. Again, that does not mean we should not try to prevent as many \nof them as we can.\n  Perhaps the answer to how to prevent them begins by asking ourselves, \nWhat do these things have in common? They have two things in common. \nThe first is that every single one of them was premeditated and \nplanned. None of these shootings were an act of passion, where someone \ngot up in the morning, was upset, and decided to do something out of \nrage. They all involved careful planning and premeditation. They \ndeliberately took steps to get the guns, the weapons, the ammunition \nthey needed. In many cases, they carefully studied the outline of the \ntarget they were going to go after. They specifically planned soft \ntargets. There is evidence of that in this case. They planned to \nmaximize the loss of life. They acquired the weapon they needed, and \nthey used tactics they needed to kill as many people as they could.\n  By the way, that premeditation and planning is one of the reasons why \nthese laws that have been proposed wouldn't have prevented it. When \nsomeone is planning and premeditating an attack, they will figure out a \nway to evade those laws or, quite frankly, to comply with them in order \nto get around them.\n  That may be an argument for new laws of a different kind, but it is \nwhat makes it hard, though not impossible.\n  The second thing they have in common is, almost all of these attacks \nwere preceded by clear signs of what was to come. A cursory review this \nmorning of just a handful of the recent cases points that out.\n  We are all familiar with the loss of life of over 20 people at a \nTexas church not long ago. This was a case of a killer whose wife had \nsaid he had tried to kill her. He was an individual who had been \narrested and convicted for domestic violence, which had, unfortunately, \nnever been reported to the background check system. He was an \nindividual who had escaped a mental health facility, who had been \ncaught sneaking guns onto an Air Force base while on Active Duty, who \nhad been discharged from the military for bad conduct, who had had \nsocial media posts that had bragged about buying dogs so as to shoot \nthem, and who had actually expressed admiration for the South Carolina \nkiller in that church killing a few years ago. He was an individual who \nhad actually been charged with animal mistreatment just a few years \nearlier.\n  At Sandy Hook, we know the killer had a spreadsheet with details of \nthe previous school shootings. He was also an individual whose mental \nstate had rapidly deteriorated to the point at which he had spoken to \nno one but his mother, whom he ultimately had killed before having \ncarried out the horrific massacre. He had been someone who had been \nisolated in a room all day, who had largely played video games.\n  The Pulse attack was precipitated and inspired by an adherence to the \njihadist ideology. As Senator Nelson has already pointed out, this \nindividual not once but twice had been on the FBI's radar screen and \nboth times had been cleared. They had interviewed him, and they had \nasked him questions. He hadn't met the standard for staying on the \nlist, and he had gone off.\n  We are still learning facts about yesterday's killer. Unlike these \nothers, we may learn more because he was apprehended alive. Authorities \nhave had an opportunity to question him, and that will continue. Here \nis what we know:\n  We know he was expelled from school for behavior the administrators \noften thought was dangerous. We know now from press accounts that both \nteachers and students did not act surprised that he was the assailant. \nIn fact, many of them said there was a running joke--obviously not a \njoke anymore--that, one day, he would do something like this. We know \nthe media and others have discovered social media posts that are, in \nhindsight, deeply disturbing, as they point to the glorification of gun \nviolence and murder and even animal cruelty, apparently. We saw reports \nthis morning of a post on YouTube a year ago on which he posted that he \nwanted to be a school shooter. The FBI was alerted to this and had \nfollowed up, by the way, in an interview with the person who had \nalerted them.\n  They all have this premeditation in common, and we sit here in \nhindsight, in seeing all of these little points and say, taken \ntogether, those are warning signs. The problem is, they are not taken \ntogether because the people who might have known about his being \nexpelled may not have known about the social media posts, and the \npeople who knew about the social media posts may not have known what he \nwrote on YouTube, and the people who knew about the YouTube may not \nhave known about the fact that the police had been called several times \nfor different reasons and so forth--hence, the challenge in finding \nsomething that works.\n  There are a lot of proposals, and I will share them because I have \nheard them before, and I hear them today. I am not diminishing them. I \ndon't want this to be taken as ``because it will not work, I don't even \nwant to hear your argument.'' I understand. I really do. You read in \nthe newspaper that they used certain kinds of guns; therefore, let's \nmake it harder to get those kinds of guns. I don't have some sort of de \nfacto religious objection to that or some ideological commitment to \nthat per se. There are all kinds of guns that are outlawed and weaponry \nthat is outlawed and/or a special category. The problem is, we did that \nonce, and it didn't work for a lot of reasons. One of them is that \nthere are already millions of them on the streets, and those things \nlast 100 years.\n  You could pass a law that makes it hard to get this kind of gun in a \nnew condition, but you are going to struggle to keep it out of the \nhands of someone who has decided that is what he wants to use because \nthere are so many of them out there already that would be grandfathered \nin.\n  You could do a background check. The truth is, in almost all of these \ncases I have cited, the individuals either erroneously passed \nbackground checks or would have passed them or did. Even if they \ncouldn't pass the background checks, they could buy the guns the way \nMS-13 does and other gangs and other street elements do--from the black \nmarket.\n  Again, it is not that we shouldn't have the background check. I am \njust\n\n\ntrying to be clear and honest here. If someone has decided ``I am going \nto commit this crime,'' he will find a way to get the gun to do it. \nThat doesn't mean you shouldn't have a law that makes it harder. It \njust means, to be honest, that it is not going to stop this from \nhappening. You could still pass the law per se, but you are still going \nto have these horrible attacks.\n  That is why I do think that in some circles, it is not fair or right \nto create this impression that somehow this attack happened yesterday \nbecause there is some law out there that we could have passed to have \nprevented it. If there had been such a law that could have prevented \nwhat happened yesterday, I think a lot of people would have supported \nit, but I also want to be honest with the people who share my point of \nview on these issues.\n  I think it is also wrong to say there is nothing we can do. I would \nadmit that, perhaps, even I in the past, in the way I have addressed \nthis issue or have spoken about it, may have come off as dismissive in \nthe argument that since none of these laws would have worked, there is \njust nothing we can do, and we will just have to deal with it. Just \nbecause I don't have a quick or an easy answer for how to prevent these \ndoesn't mean we don't have an obligation to try and find one, and by \nfinding one, I don't mean a quick and easy answer. I mean an answer \nthat would work.\n\n  When I took office here, I swore to uphold the Constitution of the \nUnited States--every element of it. I didn't write the Constitution, \nbut I agree with it, and I support it. The Second Amendment is in the \nConstitution, and you can debate what the outlines of the Second \nAmendment are or how far it goes, but it is in there, and I happen to \nsupport it. Oftentimes, I happen to point to the Second Amendment and \nsay it is the Second Amendment that is right after free speech, which \ntells you how important it was to those who wrote those words. I still \nbelieve every bit of that.\n  If it is fair to say the Second Amendment is so important--and I \nreiterate it because of how high up it is in the ranking from first to \nsecond, its being the second one--then I have to recognize there is a \npart of the Constitution that was written even before the Second \nAmendment. It is the preamble. That preamble lays out why we have a \nConstitution and, ultimately, why we have a government. In it, it reads \nthat two of the reasons we have a government and, therefore, two of the \nreasons we have a Senate is to ensure domestic tranquility and to \npromote the general welfare.\n  These school shootings and mass shootings and murders we are seeing \nnow at an accelerated pace are, by definition, a threat to our domestic \ntranquility and a threat to our general welfare--the murder of children \nin schools, the murder of moviegoers, the murder of people at a church, \nthe murder of people at a dance club on a Saturday night. These are all \nplaces at which we should be enjoying the general welfare and domestic \ntranquility.\n  Even as we recognize that the Second Amendment gives Americans the \nright to bear arms and protect themselves--a right I strongly support \nand will continue to support--we must also recognize that same \nConstitution places upon this government an obligation to ensure \ndomestic tranquility and promote the general welfare.\n  We must confront the fact that, over the last 20 years, these attacks \nhave accelerated. We must recognize the evidence that they are not \nisolated from one another and are building upon one another. We must \nrecognize the scary reality that even as the Nation mourns and the \nparents grieve, there is a high probability, if not a certainty, that \nsomewhere in America right now, some equally troubled, deranged, and \nviolent individual is reading and watching coverage of this attack and \ngaining from it not sorrow but inspiration. Even as we speak here now, \neven as we stand here in mourning, and even as the days go by, there \nare probably some people out there who are going to try to do this \nbecause of what happened yesterday. That is a frightening thought, but \nit is a reality. It challenges us to find an answer to a very difficult \nissue of all of these bits and pieces of information out there.\n  How do we in this society confront those who do things about which in \nanother era we would just say, ``Well, they are just strange people. \nThey are just weird. They are just going through a phase''?\n  We cannot do it anymore. There is no longer such a thing as just \ninnocent postings online that you just look at and say, ``Well, that is \njust them. They are just strange. They don't mean anything by it'' or \n``they are harmless.'' We cannot assume that anymore--none of us.\n  How do we create a system in which all of these disconnected pieces \nand bits of data could somehow be tied together so whenever it was that \nthis killer got ahold of these weapons and before conducting this \nattack, someone would say, ``Hold on a second. This person is the \nperson who got expelled from school, who had these social media posts, \nwho said he wanted to be a school shooter, who had his adopted mother \npass away in November and who is now living, isolated, whose fellow \nstudents had all suspected him of being a person who could, one day, be \nviolent''?\n  How do you take these bits and pieces of information and turn them \ninto a usable source of data that perhaps either prevents the \nacquisition of a weapon or, preferably, intervenes in that person's \nlife before he carries this out? If anyone here tells you he has that \none figured out, he is not being honest.\n  This is hard, but we need to do it. We need to somehow figure it out \nbecause it goes to the very core of why we exist. There is no greater \nobligation of our government than to keep our people safe from threats, \nboth foreign and domestic, and we must acknowledge that this is a \nthreat. For whatever reason, we now live in a society in which someone, \nat 19 years of age, in the freest and the most prosperous Nation in all \nof human history, has decided to take it upon himself to take the lives \nof 17 individuals and severely injure 14 others--and to actually, \nprobably, try to kill even more.\n  What is happening in our country, in our culture, in our society?\n  If there is something to be done with our laws, we should do that \ntoo. I am not saying don't focus on the gun part, but we also have to \nfocus on the violence part, for to talk about gun violence requires you \nto talk about both, and the violence part is the one that goes well \nbeyond an easy government solution and entails all kinds of different \naspects of modern life that we are still grappling with.\n  I hope we can start to figure it out. I haven't had the time, \nfrankly, in less than 18 hours, to bring to the floor a proposal for \nhow we will move forward or what the forum will be for this \nconversation to even begin. I know we can no longer just chalk it up to \njust isolated incidents because it has happened too often. Sadly, I \nbelieve it will happen again until we confront it and try to solve it. \nI hope we will, and I believe we can. I believe we must, for, as I said \nat the outset and will say in conclusion, it goes to the core of why we \neven exist to begin with--to keep our people safe no matter how new, \nhow different, or how unique the threat may be.\n  I yield the floor.\n"], "Mr. COONS": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise in this historic Chamber to offer my \nthanks, my respect, and to pay homage to an incredibly valued member of \nmy staff who is about to retire from the U.S. Senate after decades of \ndedicated service.\n  A New Englander by birth and a Delawarian by choice, Mary Ann Kelley \nhas served as my deputy scheduler now for 7 years and is due to retire \ntomorrow, March 9.\n  Mary Ann Kelley--or MAK, as she is affectionately called in my \noffice--started a career with the U.S. Senate way back in December 1990 \nas a staff assistant for then-Senator Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. \nExcept for a break in service, Mary Ann served on Senator Biden's team \nuntil he resigned to become Vice President in 2009. She stayed on \nthrough the tenure of Senator Ted Kaufman and joined my scheduling team \nlate in 2010.\n  In her having served now three U.S. Senators, Mary Ann brings a \nbreadth of knowledge and experience to my front office and scheduling \nteam. She helps to maintain my schedule, helps to organize and evaluate \nand to track hundreds of invitations and scheduling requests to \ncoworkers and constituents. Mary Ann's professionalism and business \nacumen are unwavering and valued. She always maintains her composure \ndespite the stress and sometimes craziness this unique position offers. \nMy team in Delaware appreciates her ready wit, balanced judgment, and \ncalming presence.\n  Krista Brady, my talented casework manager, said:\n\n       MAK adds that something extra Irish to the office. Every \n     morning, she comes in wearing her snazziest outfit, drinking \n     her cappuccino from Starbucks, and ready to tell a funny \n     story.\n\n  Krista reminded me about Mary Ann's love for cats, her famous \nHalloween mask, her curry chicken, and,\n\n\nof course, her wicked New England spirit.\n  Mary Ann's story is rooted deeper than in just her years of Senate \nservice. MAK's authenticity, personality, and devotion to friends and \nfamily make her a staff favorite and valued member of my team. To \nproperly honor Mary Ann, let me share some details about her background \nand her persona.\n  A graduate of Cardinal Spellman High School and Framingham State \nUniversity, Mary Ann was born and lived in Massachusetts until she \nmoved to Delaware in 1979. Ask MAK about her hometown, and she will \nquickly chime in with ``Brockton, MA--home of Rocky Marciano and Marvin \nHagler!'' Thanks to Rocky and Marvin, world heavyweight and \nmiddleweight boxing champions, Brockton is recognized as the City of \nChampions.\n  If Rocky and Marvin are Brockton's boxing champions, Mary Ann is the \ncity's undisputed world champion in cooking, whether it be baking, \nroasting, or toasting. Like Rocky and Marvin, Mary Ann has a passion \nand talent for her own chosen sport, one that she has practiced and \nrefined over many years. Marvin Hagler explained what makes a winner, \nand what Mary Ann did to become a well-seasoned top chef is the same \nthing. Marvin Hagler, the boxer, once said, ``Every fighter has got \n[to] be dedicated, learn how to sacrifice, know what devotion is all \nabout, make sure you're paying attention and studying your art.''\n  Mary Ann learned to cook at an early age. She will say that she was \nborn with a love of cooking. This interest is something she has pursued \nthrough her college years and into today. She earned a bachelor's of \nscience in food and nutrition from Framingham State in 1967 and \nsubsequently mentored and educated students as a home economics teacher \nfor 5 years. Mary Ann taught classes on food, nutrition, and, of \ncourse, cooking.\n  Over the decades, our very own MAK perfected a wide range of \ndelicacies to soothe and feed family, friends, and fellow Delawarians. \nOften, the people she fed and cared for were through her efforts at the \nMinistry of Caring in Wilmington, DE. Mary Ann worked for a decade as \nthe head chef at the Ministry of Caring, a community-based nonprofit \nthat provides a network of social, health, and support services for \nthose who are living in poverty or who are homeless. Mary Ann used her \nprofessional education, her faith, and her experience to feed the souls \nof people and provide them comfort through food served at the \nMinistry's Emmanuel Dining Room.\n  When Mary Ann returned to the Senate after her break in service, she \nrallied her coworkers to volunteer and serve food monthly at the \nEmmanuel Dining Room, where I, too, have volunteered. When I took \noffice as a Senator, we continued this outreach, and it served as a \ngreat opportunity for my casework team and others to connect with \nconstituents.\n  Besides MAK's involvement with the Ministry of Caring, for many \nyears, she owned and operated her own excellent business, Creative \nCatering Cuisine. To this day, she still receives catering requests and \ncalls from friends for cookies, cakes, and other treats. Mary Ann's \ndepth and variety of dishes are unique and storied. Staff favorites \ninclude MAK's mouth-watering filet mignon, cranberry coffee cake, Irish \ncake, banana pudding, and a wide variety of pound cakes. Lynne Phifer, \nmy intern coordinator, speaks highly of Mary Ann's homemade oatmeal \ncookies and other confections. Lynne and the rest of the team, however, \nare unanimous in their vote for MAK's curry chicken.\n  Mary Ann's food is influential and, I would say at times, even \ntranscendent. I am confident, if MAK's menu had existed in earlier \ntimes, it could have changed the course of history as we know it. If \nthis sustenance had been available in 1775, Founding Father Patrick \nHenry may have exclaimed, ``Give me Mary Ann's curry chicken or give me \ndeath!''\n  Mary Ann goes to great lengths, in all seriousness, to prepare meals \nfor those she loves. She gets the best and freshest ingredients. Some \non my staff remember the day Mary Ann returned from her lunch break \nwith a half dozen lobsters--the main course for a dinner prepared in \nhonor of her son's birthday.\n  Desiree Burritt, my immigration case worker, who also worked for \nSenators Biden and Kaufman before me, said:\n\n       Mary Ann has always been our in-house chef, always there to \n     pull up a chair, quick to smile, laugh, and listen. MAK is \n     like a mother to all of us.\n\n  Mary Ann may not know just how much she inspires and influences those \naround her. I have been moved to hear and witness the impression that \nshe has made on my staff, on her friends, and her family.\n  Terry Wright, who also previously worked for Senator Biden--a member \nof my Service Academy Selection Board--has known Mary Ann for many \nyears. Terry said Mary Ann is ``generous with an absolute willingness \nto help anyone in any way she can. When she's your friend,'' Terry \nsaid, ``you have a friend for life.''\n  Elena Sassaman, a newer member of my casework team, said:\n\n       Mary Ann is one of the nicest and most thoughtful people \n     I've met both here, working in the Senate, and in everyday \n     life. MAK was one of the first people to include me in the \n     office family dynamic when I first started.\n\n  Elena has developed a love for knitting, crocheting, and other crafts \nthanks to Mary Ann's encouragement and valued friendship.\n  When I am not in DC, I am usually in my Wilmington office in \nDelaware, and we enjoy the opportunity to have lunch as a group with \neverybody on the Delaware staff. I love those lunches, listening to \nMary Ann tell funny stories, share observations, even show photos of or \nbrag about her grandkids.\n  My dad, whom I miss dearly, was born in Boston, MA, himself, and Mary \nAnn, who never lost her remarkable Boston accent, has provided me a \nfamiliar and comforting presence whenever she speaks.\n  I love her Massachusetts spirit, her soul, and her positive attitude. \nMary Ann is a good and decent person and a great presence in our \noffice. She is at the same time both a fixture and a breath of fresh \nair.\n  Mary Ann's work in the Senate and her career as a chef shows us all \nthe importance of working hard and embracing what you love, using your \nstrengths to help your friends and neighbors and to better the country \nand community.\n  Mary Ann said she would miss all aspects of working with us in the \nSenate. It has been such a big part of her life, I know. Mary Ann, I \nknow you will also miss the comradery of your coworkers in the Delaware \noffice.\n  As a longtime chef, I am confident, Mary Ann, that you already have a \nrecipe for retirement and will embrace the joy of not working. Your \nretirement will surely be filled with activities such as cooking, \nknitting, and outings with your friends Jill, Norma, Sue, and Tanya, \nand you will spend more time with your sons Michael and Terence, \ndaughters-in-law Nell and Jennifer, and beloved grandchildren Cole, \nMitch, Meredith, and Nolan, who all live right nearby, just over the \nline in Pennsylvania. Whether their Nan is joining them for dinner or \nattending a Unionville High School rowing event, I know you will be \nthere in high spirits, prepared with a great story and an even better \ndessert.\n  Mary Ann, I know you look forward to trips to Westborough, MA, and to \nspending holidays and warmer weekends with Terence, Jennifer, Meredith, \nand Nolan.\n  Let me conclude by saying to Mary Ann, thank you for your years of \nservice to the Senate, to our community, and to the people of the First \nState. You have been a valued member of my team, and I will close with \na traditional Irish blessing:\n\n     May there always be work for your hands to do.\n     May your purse always hold a coin or two.\n     May the sun always shine on your windowpane.\n     May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain.\n     May the hand of a friend be always near you.\n     May God fill your heart with gladness to cheer you.\n\n  With that, Mary Ann, I offer you a fond farewell and a thanks to you \nfor all you have done for Delaware and the Senate.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Mr. NELSON": ["2018-02-26", "  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Georgia: \nHallelujah that you have expressed that heartfelt concern and that your \nconstituents in the State of Georgia have been very emotionally touched \nby this whole incident, this terrible incident that we have gone \nthrough again in this country. I am grateful for the comments of the \nSenator from Georgia."], "Ms. BALDWIN": ["2018-01-21", "  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be a Wisconsin Senator. \nWashington is broken. Washington isn't working for Wisconsin or \nMinnesota or the rest of America, for that matter. I rise today to call \non all my Senate colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to fix it.\n  I think it is very important for all of us to be honest with the \nAmerican people and shoot straight with how we got to this point where \nwe are today, amidst a government shutdown.\n  At the end of September, nearly 4 months ago, the Republican majority \nmissed a major deadline--a deadline to pass a budget for America and \nits government and appropriations bills that fund the government for \nthe year. Republicans have the power of the majority here in the U.S. \nSenate, in the House of Representatives, and the Presidency. Yet the \nRepublican leadership has failed--failed to put together a budget for \nAmerica and its government that provides certainty for our country. \nFamilies in Wisconsin who are struggling paycheck to paycheck put \ntogether a budget for their families because they have to in order to \nmake ends meet. But here in Washington, my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle have played by a different set of rules.\n\n  On Friday night, they didn't put forward a budget for America and its \ngovernment. Instead, they offered their fourth short-term continuing \nresolution in the last 4 months. This is no way to govern, simply \nkicking the can down the road each month and ignoring the real needs of \nour country.\n  The Federal budget is not a calendar year budget; rather, it runs \nfrom October 1 to September 30 each year. There are all sorts of \nhistorical reasons for why that is, but among them, if we get our work \ndone on time, the local governments and other entities that have \ncalendar year budgets get to see what Federal funds have been allocated \nfor the things that we do jointly that make a real difference in \npeople's lives. The Congress is actually supposed to get its budget \ndone in the spring and then finish its appropriations process by \nSeptember 30. In fact, today we should be starting our work on the 2019 \nbudget. Instead, we are still working on the 2018 budget that should \nhave been completed last spring and appropriations bills that should \nhave been done by September 30.\n  The majority had from September 30 until December 9--that was the \nfirst, short-term continuing resolution, as it is known--to get the job \ndone. On a bipartisan basis, we allocated that time through a \ncontinuing resolution. The majority then had from December 9 until \nDecember 22, another short-term continuing resolution, and then from \nDecember 22 to January 19, another continuing resolution. But the \ngoverning majority still hasn't done its work, so they asked for yet \nanother 4 weeks. This month-by-month approach from the majority has \nfailed. It has failed to provide our military and troops with the \nbudget certainty they need.\n  We heard from Secretary Mattis and his team this week about how \nharmful these continuing resolutions are to our Nation's military, and \nthe majority should heed those words because it impedes the military's \nability to plan for the defense of our Nation. Under repeated \ncontinuing resolutions, the Department can't start new programs, hiring \nand recruitment are limited, and our national security funding \npriorities are left on autopilot. The Defense Department has made it \nclear that they need a long-term budget, not week-by-week and month-by-\nmonth measures, but the majority has failed to deliver results.\n  Our veterans need VA reforms so that they can get the healthcare \nservices they have earned, and I have worked in a bipartisan manner on \na number of reforms of the VA Choice Program, but the continuing \nresolution offered--and rightly rejected by both Democrats and \nRepublicans--shortchanges veterans' health when we should be working \ntogether to serve those who have bravely served this Nation.\n  Four months ago, congressional Republicans let funding for children's \nhealthcare expire. They refused to pass legislation that funds the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, otherwise known as CHIP, and \n170,000 children in the State of Wisconsin rely on CHIP for their \nhealthcare. But the congressional Republicans were more concerned \nduring that period of time with giving away massive tax breaks; 80 \npercent-plus of the benefits go to the upper 1 percent and big \ncorporations. In fact, while these children were ignored, Republicans \ngave permanent tax cuts to powerful corporations and now won't provide \npermanent funding for the CHIP program for children's health insurance \nfor low-income families.\n  Four months ago, the majority party that controls Washington let \nfunding for community health centers lapse. In my home State, 300,000 \nWisconsinites are served by community health centers, including kids on \nCHIP. Two weeks ago, I visited one of those community health centers in \nGreen Bay, WI. The healthcare workers and staff describe the anxiety \nand uncertainty they feel every day because they don't know whether \nthey will have the funding they need to minister to the healthcare \nneeds of those whom they serve. Many community health centers can't \nmove forward with longer term contracts for services or repairs or \ninvest in new medical equipment because they don't know if or when \nWashington will act. They found out on Friday night that the continuing \nresolution offered, just like the three before it, failed to address \nfunding for community health centers once again, but it did give tax \nbreaks to big insurance companies. We cannot leave our community health \ncenters without the funding they need to serve the people for whom we \nall work. We should take action now to fully fund them because they \ncan't wait any longer.\n  I know that every one of my colleagues here in the Senate has come \nface to face with the opioid epidemic. I know I have. I have traveled \nmy State and met with healthcare workers, local officials, people from \nlaw enforcement and the judiciary who are working on the frontlines of \nthis crisis. I know what it is like to have a loved one dependent upon \nnarcotics. I have met with families who have lost a loved one to this \nepidemic. I have met with family members who are currently finding \ntheir own lives totally upended because of a loved one who is hooked on \nopioids. There is bipartisan support for doing more. There is support \nacross party lines for the Federal Government to step up and be a \nstronger partner in this fight. A short-term, stopgap measure isn't \ngoing to do it, and we all know it. So let's find the will to work \ntogether to provide strong investments in local communities so that \nthey have\n\n\nthe resources they need for prevention treatment and recovery efforts. \nLet's work together to save lives.\n  We are where we are right now because I think Washington has lost \nsight of what our work here should be about--making a difference in \npeople's lives. Hundreds of thousands of young people have had their \nlives placed in limbo by the politics of Washington. The Dreamers, who \nhave only known America as their home, are working hard. They are going \nto school. They are serving in our military. President Trump has \nthreatened them with deportation. Right now, we have a bipartisan \nsolution that Republican leadership in both the Senate and the House \nhave refused to make a commitment to passing. This bipartisan solution \nstrengthens border security and does right by the Dreamers. Just a \ncouple of weeks ago, I spoke with an education leader in Wisconsin. He \ntold me that his school, a Catholic K-12 school, employs by his count \n23 Dreamers. He can't imagine the devastating impact it might have if \nwe don't figure this out.\n  On Thursday of last week, I spoke with a Wisconsin Dreamer. She made \nher way to DC--and this wasn't her first trip--to tell her powerful \nstory. She asked for an update, and I told her what I thought was \nhappening here. She told me she had just 8 days left before her DACA \nstatus expires, and she said: I don't know what I am going to do, how I \nwill be able to work. Today, she has only 5 days left. We have a \nbipartisan solution that Senate Republicans and Democrats have worked \non together, so let's do our job and let's get it done.\n  I have the privilege of working for a State with a work ethic that is \nsecond to none. I am deeply humbled by that privilege, and I do \neverything I can to respect and reward the hard work of Wisconsinites. \nThat is why I have been working for months on pension reforms. When \npeople work hard and they play by the rules and build their retirement \nsecurity, they should be able to depend on the pensions they have \nearned. Right now, 25,000 Wisconsin retirees and workers have had their \npensions threatened through no fault of their own. I have visited with \nthese workers throughout the State of Wisconsin in Green Bay, in \nEndeavor, in Milwaukee, and Brookfield--hundreds of them. They each \nhave a powerful story. I spoke to one worker who started his job as a \ntrucker at age 23. He worked for 40 years. At several stages in his \ncareer, he had the opportunity, if you will call it that, to forgo a \npotential increase in wages so that he could put more into his pension, \nso he and his wife could enjoy a secure retirement. But today he and \nthousands of others are facing the prospect of massive cuts to the \npensions they have earned, unless Congress acts. They can't afford to \nhave us kick the can down the road once again. They need us to act and \nkeep the promises of the pensions they worked so hard for. Let's work \ntogether. Let's work together and get the job done by passing the Butch \nLewis Act and save the pensions that over a million workers and \nretirees across this country are counting on.\n  Mr. President, enough of round after round of fighting. The American \npeople are fed up with it. They did not send us here to perform a \nmonthly melodrama. They sent us here to get things done. They didn't \nsend us here to play political games and create chaos. They sent us \nhere to work together on solutions to the problems that they face and \nthat we face jointly as a nation. The biggest problem we face right now \nis that Washington is broken. It is up to us to fix it, so let's start \nworking together to get the job done.\n  I yield the floor."], "The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy)": ["2018-02-15", "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy).

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  We are here at a critical time for our democracy because our country \nis under attack. In fact, we are here because Russia is attacking our \ndemocracy as part of a campaign of informational warfare. That term is \nnot mine; it is Russia's. It is quoted in an indictment that was handed \ndown by the special counsel less than a month ago against 13 \nindividuals and 3 entities. That document is absolutely stunning. It is \nchilling in its detail and breadth and in its revelations about the \napparatus and personnel, the skills and expertise that Russia \nmethodically and relentlessly brought to bear in the 2016 election, in \nits attack on our democracy.\n  That attack began in 2014. It was not a few hackers in the basement \nof some Moscow apartment; it was literally thousands of people, divided \ninto different departments with different skills, pursuing \ndisinformation, cyber attack, misinformation, and propaganda directed \nat undermining our democracy and, in fact, our election.\n  Let's remember, constitutionally, elections are foundational to our \ndemocracy, and Russia sought not just to sow discord and dissension but \nto affect the outcome. According to the indictment, its effort to \naffect the outcome was to assist then-Candidate Donald Trump and to \ndisparage and damage Hillary Clinton. We will never know how much it \naffected the outcome, but it certainly impacted the views and the votes \nof some people in the United States of America.\n  That attack is now continuing. Our intelligence community is \nunanimous in the view that Russia interfered in our last election and \nthat this effort is continuing. Indeed, all of the intelligence \ncommunity that has come before the Armed Services Committee in the last \n2 weeks has been unanimous that Russia is continuing its attack.\n  In his testimony, Admiral Rogers is very clear that they will \ncontinue that attack because they are paying no price for it. The cost \nto them is minimal, if any, and the benefit is highly asymmetrical. In \nother words, they pay very, very little to undermine our democracy, and \nthey see a lot of return. That is because this country is doing little \nor nothing--or I should say more accurately that this administration is \ndoing absolutely nothing to make Russia pay a price. In effect, that is \nthe testimony from representatives of the intelligence community, \nincluding, most recently today, the Director of National Intelligence, \nDan Coats, and GEN Robert Ashley.\n  When I asked what was being done to deter, counter, or retaliate \nagainst the Russians, Director Coats said, in effect, that it is \neveryone's responsibility, which means, in effect, it is no one's \nresponsibility; that it was the whole of government responding, which \nmeans no single agency, and there is no plan and no action underway. \nThere is at most perhaps some kind of study of what should be done.\n  But the denial of meddling is really the reason why nothing has been \ndone and why no action is underway, and that denial comes from one \nperson--the President of the United States. He has refused to \nacknowledge that the Russians interfered on the scale and scope that \nthey did, and that denial or refusal to acknowledge is itself a \ntremendous boon to the Russians continuing to attack our democracy.\n  As recently as this afternoon, at his press conference with the \nSwedish Prime Minister, the President said, in effect, that perhaps \nRussia might have meddled, other countries might have meddled, and \nother individuals might have meddled, but he has refused to acknowledge \nthe extent and the depth and breadth of past and continuing Russian \ninterference in our democracy.\n  Make no mistake--others of us on both sides of the aisle have said \nthat the Russians will escalate in the sophistication of their attacks, \nin the depth of their interference, in the types of tools used through \ncyber and social media and platforms that are now being developed. They \nwill use American voices. There will no longer be the broken English, \nno longer be the payment in rubles. They will become ever-more astute \nand adroit in their attack on our democracy.\n  So the question is, Why? Why has the President declined to \nacknowledge this attack--a continuing assault on our democratic \ninstitutions, particularly on our elections, which are foundational to \nour democracy? Some have put it this way: What do the Russians have on \nhim? But my view is that we need to look back at the knowledge that the \nTrump campaign had of that attack in 2016 as it was proceeding.\n  To take one example, the stolen or hacked emails. Clearly, Trump \ncampaign contacts with WikiLeaks and Russia show that the campaign knew \nabout those stolen or hacked emails, which were then used to attack the \nClinton campaign. If those members of the Trump campaign knew about \nit--those in responsible positions--the question is, How could the \nPresident not have known?\n\n\n  In April of 2016, George Papadopoulous, a member of the Trump foreign \npolicy team for at least a substantial period of time, was eager to \ncommunicate with senior staff of the Trump campaign that he knew the \nRussians had hacked emails and that those emails could help the Trump \ncampaign. He was anxious to ingratiate himself with his connections to \nmake himself more valuable in their eyes. So he boasted, in effect, \nabout his contacts with Russians and with Russian officials. \nPapadopoulous was already working overtime to ingratiate himself with \nthe Trump campaign leadership, and he certainly was not likely to keep \nvaluable information about stolen emails possessed by the Russians to \nhimself.\n  Remember, when the Trump campaign--specifically Donald Trump, Jr.--\nwas offered dirt on Hillary Clinton, he replied: ``I love it.'' From \neverything we know about Donald Trump, Jr.'s relationship to his \nfather, he is unlikely to have kept that information to himself.\n  George Papadopoulous is one of several Trump associates who seemed to \nknow that Russia was trying to help the Trump campaign win the 2016 \nelection. Donald Trump, Jr., again, was in contact with WikiLeaks \nbeginning in September of 2016, and we know this communication \ncontinued at least through July of 2017. We know that Donald Trump, \nJr., turned over these messages to investigators. When Trump, Jr., \nreceived the first message from WikiLeaks, he emailed other senior \nofficers within the Trump campaign. Those officers included Steve \nBannon, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale, and Trump's son-in-law, Jared \nKushner. How could that information and other similar communications \nnot have been transmitted to Donald Trump himself?\n  Donald Trump, Jr., received an email in which Rob Goldstone offered \nto provide the Trump campaign with some official documents from Russia \nthat would supposedly incriminate Hillary Clinton. We know now that \nDonald Trump, Jr., jumped at the chance to receive this information, \nresponding with the famous: ``If it's what you say, I love it.'' That, \nthen, led to the meeting involving Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul \nManafort at Trump Tower.\n  There is more here that raises the likelihood of collusion. There is \na credible case of obstruction of justice against the President of the \nUnited States. There is a solid factual basis to believe that the Trump \ncampaign not only knew but encouraged and cooperated and even colluded \nwith the Russians in this effort. If motive is necessary for the Trump \ncampaign to have done this kind of collusion--certainly it is in the \nprospect of impacting the outcome. If motive is necessary for President \nTrump now refusing to acknowledge Russian meddling during the election \ncampaign and now continuing meddling, it is collusion as well.\n  So we are in a dangerous time because, in fact, Russia will continue \nto interfere and undermine our democracy if it pays no price for it. \nThe only way to make sure Russia will pay a price to counter, deter, or \nretaliate is for the President of the United States to demonstrate \nleadership and to put aside whatever concern about legitimacy there may \nbe. No one is relitigating the 2016 election as to what the outcome \nwas, in fact. We have a President in office, but that President now \nmust act to protect our democracy and our elections going forward from \nthis day into the future.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from Illinois."], "Mr. MENENDEZ": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to explain my opposition to the \nbill that is before the Senate, the banking deregulation bill, S. 2155.\n  First, I would like to say I am appalled this is how the Senate is \nspending its time this week. Three weeks ago, 17 students and teachers \nwere murdered when a teenager, armed with an AR-15 decorated with \nswastikas, opened fire at Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, but \nthis week we are not banning the sale of high-capacity magazines that \nenable mass shooters to fire 30, 40, or even 100 rounds without \nstopping to reload; we are not closing the gun show loophole or \nstopping violent people from buying assault weapons online with the \nclick of a mouse; we are not taking steps to report more cases of \nsevere mental illness to the National Instant Criminal Background Check \nSystem; we are not even passing President Trump's proposal to raise the \nage one can buy an assault weapon to 21 years. Simply put, this week we \nare not doing anything to stop the next mass shooting from taking \nplace.\n  So what are we doing this week?\n  Well, this week the Republican majority has brought to the floor \nlegislation rolling back safeguards we passed after the financial \ncrisis of 2008--not exactly something the American people have been \nclamoring for.\n  I want to be clear why I oppose this bill as written. It is not that \nI don't support measures that provide meaningful relief to small banks, \ncredit unions, and consumers. I do. It is not that I don't believe in \nreexamining regulations and ways to reduce compliance costs. I do. It \nis not that I don't agree with efforts to better calibrate the rules of \nthe road for small banks and credit unions while strengthening \nprotections for consumers investors and taxpayers. I do. Indeed, I \nwould support a bill like that, but that is not the bill we have before \nus today.\n\n  The bill before us today brings back risky mortgage lending practices \nthat increase the likelihood of foreclosures. It undermines our efforts \nto police discriminatory lending practices, and it would allow 25 of \nAmerica's 38 biggest banks to escape the safeguards we adopted after \nthe 2008 financial crisis--a crisis that destroyed more than $12 \ntrillion worth of American wealth, required huge bank bailouts, sent \nour economy into a tailspin, and saddled us with the great recession.\n  Ten years later, it is worth remembering what caused that crisis--\nmortgages designed like ticking timebombs for home buyers and for our \neconomy at large, large financial institutions making risky bets on \nthose risky mortgages, and regulators who turned a blind eye to these \nrisks. Borrowers were steered into loans with low interest rates, often \nbelow 4 percent at the start, but once the promotional period ended, \nthese teaser rates disappeared, higher interest rates kicked in, and \nmillions of borrowers suddenly saw their mortgage payments go through \nthe roof--even doubling, in many cases. Between 2004 and 2006, one-\nthird of all adjustable rate mortgages were designed this way, and at a \ntime of stagnant wages, millions of families couldn't keep up. That is \nwhy a wave of foreclosures overtook our housing market--displacing \nfamilies, decimating home values, and destabilizing neighborhoods. From \n2006 to 2014, more than 9.3 million families lost their homes to \nforeclosure, sold their homes at a significant loss, or surrendered \ntheir homes to the bank.\n  For communities of color, the crisis was even worse. African-American \nand Latino borrowers were at least twice as likely to receive a higher \ncost loan than White applicants, even when controlling for income and \ncredit scores, and they were nearly 50 percent more likely to face \nforeclosure during the crisis.\n  So what did we do about it? Well, we passed laws to stop lenders from \noffering mortgages that were, in many ways, doomed to fail. We said \nthat from now on banks and mortgage lenders would have to make a \nreasonable and good-faith determination that borrowers could pay back \ntheir loans by looking at income, employment, credit history, monthly \nexpenses, and other metrics. We prohibited banks from using these \nteaser rates to determine whether a borrower could repay a loan. We did \nthe sensible thing, and we required them to make sure that borrowers \ncould actually afford their payments once the higher interest rates \nkicked in.\n  We also passed reforms to better catch discriminatory lending \npractices because we know that, in many cases, the riskiest products \nwere offered to minority communities. We asked banks to provide data \nthat they already collected on things like debt-to-income ratios, \ncredit scores, loan-to-value ratios, interest rates, and loan terms. \nThis way, we could better identify emerging risks and possible \ndiscriminatory lending practices in our communities. Were all of these \nreforms perfect? Of course not. Have they made our mortgage lending \nsystem safer, smarter, and fairer for credit borrowers? Absolutely. \nDoes that mean we still don't face challenges? No. New Jerseyans know \nthat. Our State still suffers the highest rate of foreclosure in the \nNation, and many New Jersey neighborhoods still struggle with frequent \nforeclosures, abandoned homes, and their painful consequences.\n  Likewise, discrimination still persists. I was appalled by a report \nreleased in January that showed African-American and Latino families--\neven controlling for income, loan amount, and location--continue to be \ndisproportionately denied conventional mortgages. These practices are \nnothing short of modern-day redlining. We see it in Camden, NJ, for \nexample, where Black applicants are still more than 2\\1/2\\ times \nlikelier to be denied than White applicants.\n  Now, 10 years after the crisis, Congress is poised to turn back the \nclock. Under this bill, some banks will once again be able to offer \nmortgages with teaser rates of 4 percent that more than double in just \n2 years, without ever verifying if a borrower could afford a 9-percent \ninterest rate, and all they have to do is keep the loans on their \nbooks.\n  This bill will excuse 85 percent of banks from sharing the data we \nneed to identify discrimination and ensure all creditworthy borrowers \nhave a fair shot at the American dream of home ownership. So if this \nsounds familiar, that is because it is. History is repeating itself.\n  Beyond making mortgage lending riskier and less fair, this bill \nremoves guardrails we put in place for 25 of the 38 largest banks in \nthe country. These are the banks identified as systemically important \nduring the crisis--the banks that received $47 billion in bailouts.\n  Now, I appreciate my colleagues who point out this bill's benefits \nfor community banks and credit unions--and I mean that. That is a good \nthing. But I fear these provisions mask giveaways that will make big \nbanks bigger and, ultimately, hurt smaller banks struggling to compete. \nUnder title IV, for example, this bill significantly cuts oversight of \nbanks with assets between $50 billion and $250 billion.\n  Have we forgotten so quickly the lessons we learned after the crisis? \nDo we not remember how the government had to arrange forced mergers of \nCountrywide, with $200 billion in assets, and National City, with $145 \nbillion in assets, because their near-failures worked to spread risk \nfrom Wall Street to Main Street?\n  Do we really want to weaken these guardrails--the stress tests and \nthe capital planning requirements to ensure that banks can survive a \ncrisis, the living wills that ensure they have a feasible way to unwind \nif things go badly, and the minimum liquid assets they must hold in the \nevent they lose access to funding markets?\n  When taxpayer dollars are on the line, I don't think it is unfair to \nask big banks to be safe and smart. On the contrary, it is unfair to \nthe American people who will have to bail them out when and if they get \ninto trouble.\n  Supporters of this bill are quick to point out that it preserves the \nFederal Reserve's authority to take action if they become concerned \nabout a bank with less than $250 billion in assets. Well, forgive me \nfor not having confidence in regulators with a long history of doing \ntoo little too late. That is exactly the kind of risk that taxpayers,\n\n\nhomeowners, and investors can't afford.\n  As the chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission recently \nwrote, ``history has shown, time and again, that the failure of \nfinancial firms that are not among the largest mega-banks can pose \nsystemic risks to financial stability.'' According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, these weaker protections make it even more likely that \ntaxpayers will once again have to bail out banks.\n  At the end of the day, this bill injects tremendous risk into the \nsystem and undercuts our tools to have our financial cops on the beat \nactually work to monitor the risk. So that leaves taxpayers on the hook \nif risk then turns into crisis. Rather than protecting families, this \nbill is packed full of goodies for large banks and special interests, \nbecause consumers--the families who would suffer the most in another \ncrisis--don't have a seat at the table.\n  As a member of the Banking Committee, I worked in good faith to amend \nthis bill and make it better. I offered an amendment called \nChristopher's Law to better protect consumers like the Bryski family in \nNew Jersey. While mourning the tragic loss of their son Christopher, \nthe Bryskis were stunned to learn that they would be responsible for \npaying an education their son could never use because they had cosigned \nhis private student loan. I appreciate that my colleagues incorporated \nmajor components of Christopher's Law to protect families that suffer \nthe tragic loss of a loved one into the manager's package for this \nbill.\n  When you look at the totality of the bill's provisions, the fact \nremains that we couldn't get an inch for consumers in exchange for the \nmiles this bill gives to big banks. Take, for example, my amendment to \nenhance protections for military servicemembers who often struggle to \nprotect their credit while they are serving our country abroad or the \namendment I offered to prevent the rewards of this bill from flowing to \nbanks that adopt punishing, Wells-Fargo-style sales cultures that put \nconsumers at risk. These are just some of the pro-consumer, commonsense \namendments that were rejected in the Banking Committee.\n  Ultimately, I still believe Congress could pass legislation that \nprovides targeted relief to community banks and credit unions, but not \nin exchange for erasing the standards that protect working families and \nour economy from systemic risk. So you can bet that I will be working \nhere on the floor to get those amendments included in full. Senator \nCortez Masto and I will offer an amendment to ensure that banks report \nthe data we need to police against discriminatory lending practices.\n  Likewise, I am offering an amendment to require that consumer \nreporting agencies like Equifax quickly disclose data breeches and \nrequire a Federal study of how these breeches impact consumers over the \nlong haul.\n  Finally, I am proposing an amendment that requires mutual funds to \ndisclose to their shareholders whether they invest in the gun industry, \nbecause it is downright offensive to be considering a banking bill this \nweek instead of pressing corporate America to step up in the fight \nagainst gun violence that rips our country apart year after year.\n  These measures, if adopted, would make a bad bill a bit better, but \nas we quickly approach the 10-year anniversary of the government-backed \nbailout of Bear Stearns, I cannot, in good conscience, vote to remove \nthe guardrails we put in place to prevent big banks from playing fast \nand loose with our economy in the first place.\n  The financial crisis and recession stripped trillions of dollars in \nwealth from communities all across the country. While banks were bailed \nout, families were left reeling with the consequences. From foreclosure \nto job losses to hard-hit retirement accounts and falling home values, \nthe American people bore the brunt of the financial crisis. For years, \nWashington protected Wall Street from sensible regulations when we \nshould have been protecting consumers. Unfortunately, it took the \ngreatest financial crisis since the Great Depression for us to pass the \nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act for us to make a \nfundamental choice to reject a system that took advantage of consumers \nand instead stand for a banking system that is more fair, transparent, \nand accountable to the American people.\n  To quote the Spanish philosopher George Santayana, ``those who cannot \nremember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' Only in Washington \nwould anyone think it is a good idea to commemorate the 10-year \nanniversary of the financial crisis with a bill that dares big banks to \nget bigger and increases risks to taxpayers.\n  I look forward to the day when this Congress strives to do better by \nthe working families who lost their homes, their jobs, and their life \nsavings during the crisis. Hard-working families had to fight their way \nback from the recession without bailouts and are counting on us to \nfight for them in Washington, and that is what I intend to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Mr. LEAHY": ["2018-02-26", "  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on February 18, 2018, New Hampshire lost \none of its finest lawyers and humanitarians, Maurice Duane Geiger. He \nwas 83 years old.\n  Some might ask why, as a Senator from Vermont, I would call the \nSenate's attention to a resident of our neighbor to the east. In fact, \nMaury Geiger not only had close ties to Vermont where, in 1982, he \ncofounded the Rural Justice Center in Montpelier, he was in every \nrespect a global citizen. Over his long career, he worked to improve \naccess to justice in Haiti, Bangladesh, Rwanda, and several other \ncountries.\n  I met Maury Geiger years ago and will never forget going with him, my \nwife, Marcelle, and my staff member Tim Rieser to visit the national \npenitentiary in Port au Prince, Haiti. A more squalid example of a \ncorrections facility would be hard to imagine. It was overflowing with \nthousands of impoverished men of all ages, sweltering in the heat and \nhumidity, crammed into cement rooms with nothing to sleep on but the \nfloor, with little food and vulnerable to AIDS, tuberculosis, and other \ndangerous diseases, and the vast majority had never been formally \ncharged with any crime. Some had languished there for 2 or more years, \nfar longer than any sentence they would have received if tried and \nconvicted. Almost none had lawyers.\n  After first laying eyes on that unforgettable scene of inhumane \nneglect, Maury returned to Haiti year after year, determined to do \nwhatever he could to help improve the lives and protect the rights of \nthose caught up in Haiti's corrupt, dysfunctional justice system. It \nwas that same passion for justice that took him to the courts and jails \nof rural America and to distant places like Addis Abba and Tbilisi.\n  As his obituary describes, Maury was born into poverty, and that \nexperience, and his mother's guidance, shaped his character. He served \nas a naval aviator and then at the Department of Justice. He was as \npatriotic and as fierce a defender of the Constitution and Bill of\n\n\nRights as anyone I have known. He became one of our country's first \nexperts in court administration, and he worked throughout his life to \nteach others about the fundamentals of a modern justice system.\n  Maury loved his work, and he cared passionately about fairness. He \ndevoted his life to fighting for justice at every opportunity. Knowing \nwhat it means to be poor, Maury did not hold himself above anyone. He \nwas not the least bit impressed by wealth or titles. He loathed the \nself-importance of so many government officials and the abuse of power, \nespecially when it was at the expense of those without power, which is \nso common in places like Haiti where inequality is glaring and the rule \nof law barely exists. He was known for his irreverence, just as he was \nfor his wonderful, dry sense of humor.\n  Over the years, I have met countless accomplished people, many of \nthem of the highest integrity. Maury Geiger could match any of them. He \nwas as ethical, selfless, compassionate, and determined a champion of \nthe less fortunate as anyone I have known.\n  My thoughts are with Nancy, his wife of 58 years, and their four \nsons, Robert, Kevin, Tom, and Steven. I know they are all proud of the \nprincipled example Maury set for all of us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the February 20 obituary of Maurice \nDuane Geiger in the Conway Daily Sun be printed in the Record."], "Mrs. FEINSTEIN": ["2018-02-07", "  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a Senate \nResolution recognizing February 7, 2018 as ``National Girls & Women in \nSports Day''. Since the passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments \nof 1972, our Nation has taken many big steps toward achieving equality \nfor women in our Nation's athletic institutions. In fact, since then, \nparticipation by high school girls in athletic programs has increased \nmore than six fold. And in college sports, participation by women \nathletes has nearly tripled since the passage of Title IX.\n  However, many disparities still exist between male and female \nathletic programs in our Nation today. Because there are simply fewer \nathletic opportunities and programs for girls, there are lower levels \nof participation in sports amongst present day high school girls than \nthere were for high school boys in the 1970s.\n  Across college campuses, women athletes still comprise only 44 \npercent of the collegiate athlete population. And in some instances, \nthe numbers have even shrunk over time. In 1972, women occupied more \nthan 90 percent of coaching positions with collegiate women's teams. \nToday, women occupy less than half of these coaching positions.\n  This resolution recognizes how far we have come, but more \nimportantly, it acknowledges how much farther we still have to go to \nachieve equality for our female athletes. In looking to the future and \nresolving together that more must be done to provide girls and women \nequal opportunity in sports, we also celebrate and recognize female \nathletes from the past who have faced difficult obstacles in their \nlives to advance the participation of women in sports.\n  We honor athletes like Althea Gibson, who was the first African-\nAmerican athlete to break down racial barriers in international tennis \nand who, in 1956, became the first person of color to win a Grand Slam \ntennis title with her victory at the French Open.\n  We celebrate ``Babe'' Didrikson Zaharias, who, in addition to the \nOlympic medals she won at the 1932 Olympic Games in track and field, \nchallenged conventions in the sport of golf to become the first woman \nin history who attempted to qualify in the U.S. Open tournament.\n  We salute Wilma Rudolph, who in the 1960s was considered the fastest \nwoman in the world and, with her performance at the 1960 Olympic Games, \nwas the first American woman to achieve three gold medals at any single \nOlympics event in history.\n  Each of these women faced tremendous difficulties to break down \nbarriers in their respective sports to change not just the culture of \nsports in our Nation, but ultimately, to improve our country. Their \nnames were inscribed in sports history, and in the process they became \npositive role models for entire generations of female athletes who \ncontinue to inspire us all with their talents. Finally, this resolution \nrecognizes the importance of supporting girls and women in sports by \nholding to account those who use their positions of power--both \nindividual and institutional in nature--to abuse and exploit.\n  Mr. President, our Nation continues to struggle with the revelations \nthat hundreds of young female athletes were sexually abused within USA \nGymnastics affiliated institutions. The stories of these survivors, who \nendured such horrific abuse at the hands of professionals entrusted to \ndevelop their athletic talents, are absolutely heartbreaking and our \nNation must do more to prevent these crimes from ever happening again. \nTo put an end to this abuse, on January 30, 2018, Congress passed the \nProtecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization \nAct of 2017, which I had authored and introduced to require all Olympic \nsports organizations and amateur sports organizations to immediately \nreport allegations of sexual abuse to law enforcement.\n  As the Winter Olympics begin this week in South Korea, our Nation \nmust continue to do everything we can to enforce this legislation and \nadvocate on behalf of these young athletes whose lives have been turned \nupside down by the abuse that they endured.\n  I would also like to thank the National Women's Law Center and the \nNational Girls & Women in Sports Day Coalition for their support of \nthis resolution. All young people in our Nation deserve equal access to \nfreely participate in athletic programs and to feel safe and secure so \nthey can thrive within their chosen sports. With these goals in mind, I \ncall on all of us to examine the progress we have made and\n\n\ncommit ourselves to addressing the inequalities we must still overcome \nto empower female athletes in our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n"], "Mr. BENNET": ["2018-02-26", " Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to celebrate the diamond \njubilee birthdays of the Honorable Wilma and Wellington Webb.\n  Wilma and Wellington Webb embody the best of Colorado. Through a long \nand distinguished career, they have made history, improved our \ncommunities, and set an example of leadership for our State.\n  Wilma Webb's life is defined by service to others. Her career began \nas a community organizer registering voters, assisting impoverished \nfamilies, and fighting for equality in education. In 1980, she joined \nthe Colorado House of Representatives, where she was reelected for six \nterms and served a total of 13 years. During her tenure, Wilma \nsponsored many substantive bills and became the first African American \nto serve on the powerful joint budget committee, which writes \nColorado's multibillion dollar annual budget. After 4 years of tireless \nadvocacy, she pushed through legislation to recognize Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr.'s birthday in Denver through events like the annual \n``Marade.'' President Clinton later appointed her to serve as the \nregional administrator for the U.S. Department of Labor.\n  Her husband, Wellington Webb, likewise displays an example of public \nservice. Mayor Webb has served in the Colorado House of \nRepresentatives, the Carter administration, and Colorado's Department \nof Regulatory Agencies. In a historic election in 1991, he became the \nfirst African-American mayor of Denver. Over two terms, Mayor Webb \ndedicated himself to improving Denver's parks and open spaces, \nstrengthening public safety, championing inclusive economic \ndevelopment, and expanding access to high-quality education for our \nchildren. Like his wife, Mayor Webb's leadership has left an indelible \nmark. We see it throughout our city, from the Denver International \nAirport to the expanded Denver Art Museum, the Blair-Caldwell African-\nAmerican Research Library, and the many buildings that bear his name.\n  As individuals, Wilma and Wellington Webb are exceptional examples of \npublic service. Together, they have formed an extraordinarily powerful \nforce that has left Denver and Colorado more prosperous, inclusive, and \njust.

Mr. President, I am grateful to my colleague from \nTennessee for yielding to me.\n  One of the reasons Howard Baker was one of the great leaders in this \nplace is he had good staff, and one of those folks, who was maybe the \nsenior member of his staff lo those many years ago, was Lamar \nAlexander, now Senator Alexander. Howard Baker would be very proud of \nthe kind of Senator he has become--a great Governor, Secretary of \nEducation. He is someone who speaks, more often than not, with great \nwisdom. He and I agree on not everything but pretty much everything.\n  I am mister glass half full. My wife says to me that I need to be \nmore of a realist. She says I am too much of an optimist. I am not an \noptimist today. I feel like we leave here--get on a train, go home--\nfeeling like we have not done our job.\n  The Senator from Tennessee has said that the President did his job, \nbut I just don't agree. I just don't agree. He served as Governor; I \nserved as Governor. if we had an impasse on a difficult issue in \nDelaware--we are lucky; we are a small state--we can pull people \ntogether to resolve just about anything and figure out what we call the \nfour c's. One of those is close to Delaware. No. 1 is communicate. No. \n2 is compromise. No. 3 is collaborate. No. 4 is civility. Those are the \nfour c's. That is the reason why we had some success in our State.\n\n  I am not sure we really demonstrated enough of those today. I am not \nsure the President did as much as he could have done and should have \ndone. We have a Bible study that meets here on Thursdays, as the \nSenator from Tennessee knows. Seven or eight of us that need the most \nhelp meet with the Chaplain of the Senate, Barry Black, retired rear \nadmiral and chief of chaplains for the Navy and Marine Corps.\n  Today in our Bible study, he mentioned the golden rules: Treat people \nthe way we want to be treated. Love\n\n\nthy neighbor as thyself. And ask the question: Who is our neighbor? He \ntold the parable about the Good Samaritan. Oftentimes, he mentioned \nMatthew 25, which deals with the least of these. When I was hungry, did \nyou feed me? When I was naked, did you clothe me? When I was thirsty, \ndid you give me a drink? When I was sick and in prison, did you visit \nme? When I was a stranger in your land, did you welcome me?\n  I think there is a moral imperative here. In the case where young \npeople were brought here when they were very young from another country \nby their parents, have grown up here, were educated here, and are \nworking here in all kinds of jobs--jobs that need to be filled--to say \nby our actions today that sometime in March--maybe March 5--a lot of \nthem will be facing the prospect of being rounded up and sent back to \nwhere they were born, I think, there is a moral imperative that says \nthat is not right.\n  In Delaware State University, we have any number of Dreamers who are \nstudents there. They are the most impressive young people I have met in \nmy life. They are smart. They work hard. They are good students. They \nare going to go off and be great employees. They are going to start \nbusinesses of their own. For us to say that there is a good chance that \nyou will be sent back to where you were born, doesn't make a whole lot \nof sense to me. I think it is morally wrong.\n  I think it is also economically wrong. Today, a bunch of folks in the \nlandscaping business came to see me. They wanted to talk about the \nproblems they have getting people to come to work for their firms, to \nwork for their companies, and to do landscaping work. It is not easy \nwork. It is hard to find people to do it. In many cases, the folks that \nwill do it come day after day--a day's work for a day's pay. They are \npeople who have come here from other countries. The landscapers today--\nI don't know if they are Democrats or Republicans--are frustrated \nbecause they have a good business and customers need their work to be \ndone, and they have a hard time getting Americans born and raised here \nto do the work.\n  Earlier this week, on Monday, I was in Georgetown, DE. We raise more \nchickens in Sussex County, DE, than anywhere in America. There are 400 \nchickens for every person who lives in my State. Poultry is a big \nbusiness. We met with folks from the Delmarva Peninsula who are very \nmuch involved in the poultry industry. They said basically the same \nthing we heard today from the landscapers: We have a hard time finding \npeople who will work in poultry plants. We have done a lot of things we \ncan to enhance the pay and the benefits. We have wellness centers. We \nprovide incentives for people who want to improve themselves, go on, \nand have a chance to move up the ladder of success.\n  But there was one lady who said that she is from a major poultry \ncompany. I think it was Perdue. She said: We are trying to fill \npositions. We have 100 people who offer to come in for an interview. \nShe said that out of the 100, they actually have 20 that reach the \nsecond step because they can pass the blood test and meet other \nchallenges they have, or obstacles, in order to reach the next rung on \nthe ladder for an interview. They start with 100 and are down to 20 \nalmost like that. Out of those 20, she said, eventually 5 will be able \nto pass the drug test and have the work experience and the willingness \nto work. She said they end up with five to hire. Out of those five they \nhire, a number of them stop coming to work a month later. She said that \nis what they face; that is reality. And then she said: Please help us. \nIn fact, all the poultry industry people we met on Monday said: Please \nhelp us with this.\n  As it turns out, it is not just landscaping businesses that need \npeople to work. It is not just food processors--poultry in this case. \nWhen we received the monthly jobs report earlier this month for the \nmonth of January, we were told that the unemployment rate is about 4.1 \npercent--steady where it was. We are still under way with the longest \nrunning economic expansion. I think we are past 8 years now. When \npeople went to work today, there were about 2 to 3 million jobs that \nwere not filled. When folks went to work in this country today across \nAmerica, for about 2 to 3 million jobs, nobody showed up to do the job. \nIt makes no sense to me that we face the prospect of 700,000, 800,000 \npeople who were raised here, were educated here, work here, want to \nwork here, and want to contribute, could do those jobs, and they may \nnot get a chance to do them.\n  Employers have risen up with one voice, from the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Business \nRoundtable, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and the \nFarm Bureau--you name it--to say: We have a problem on the human \nresources side with getting people to come to work.\n  I think it is economic insanity for us to say that for 700,000 or \n800,000 people and maybe a couple hundred thousand people that came \nhere from El Salvador: We are going to send you home.\n  It makes no sense.\n  I hope my friend is right. I hope we leave here, come back in a week \nor so, and say: How do we get to an agreement?\n  The last thing I will say is this. Border security is really \nimportant. I was chairman of the Homeland Security Committee for a \nwhile. I am still the senior Democrat on the committee. If you compare \nborder security in this country today to what it was 10, 20 years ago, \nit is a more secure border. It should be. We spent a fortune. We have \n20,000 people down in border security. We are doing a lot of smarter \nthings.\n  I will conclude with this point. Included in the proposal today that, \nI think, got the most votes--54 votes--was the Collins, King, et al. \nIncluded in that package were a number of what I call force \nmultipliers. They would actually make the border more secure. There is \nsomeplace along the border where a wall makes sense, like in San Diego. \nI was stationed in the Navy in San Diego. There are some places there, \nand there are other places where a wall makes sense. I heard more than \na few times: If you build a 15-foot wall, someone will come along with \nan 18-foot ladder, or come along with a tunnel to go under it.\n  There are a lot of things we can do to assist the 20,000 Border \nPatrol men and women we have. We are having a hard time filling those \n20,000 positions. We have hundreds of those jobs vacant today.\n\n  Do you know where we could put people to work on the border? At ports \nof entry, where hundreds of millions of dollars of commerce are coming \nthrough every week--coming up from Mexico and going down into Mexico. \nThere is a crying need for 3,000 people to work as Customs officers at \nthe ports of entry.\n  My colleague talks, as he should, about concern about drugs coming \ninto our country. Right now, the biggest threat is from China. They are \ncoming over here ordered by the internet. There is stuff coming in by \nthe mail service. Senator Portman and I are working to do a much \ntighter job in that regard to stop the importation of fentanyl through \nthe Postal Service.\n  There are a bunch of things that we can do on the border that were \nincluded in the bipartisan proposal today. I will mention a couple of \nthem. It is not just enough to have drones. You have to have drones \nthat you can fly. You have to have good surveillance systems. You have \nto have people who maintain them. And they don't just fly 8 hours out \nof every 24. They are able to be up in the sky throughout the day and \nthroughout the week with the kind of surveillance systems that are \nneeded.\n  It is not just enough to have a couple of helicopters that can fly \nevery day, but they have to be able to go 24/7 and have the same kind \nof surveillance systems that are good. With fixed-wing aircraft, the \nsame is true. I was a naval flight officer of a P-3 air mission \ncommand. We did a lot of surface surveillance and chased submarines all \nover the world. They would send us out in the ocean to look for \nsomebody's ship that had sunken or a sailboat that had sunken. \nSometimes all we would have in the middle of the ocean was a pair of \nbinoculars--good luck finding anybody.\n  We don't have to just use binoculars on the border, with drones, \nfixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, fixed-wing towers, or mobile towers. \nWe have surveillance systems that can enable us to see 15, 20, 25 miles \ninto Mexico. We should use them and make sure they are maintained and \nthat people are trained to operate them.\n  When you have hundreds of miles of river, building a wall there \ndoesn't\n\n\nmake sense. Boats do and boat ramps make sense. In places where the \nwall may not make sense, a fence may make sense. Roads along the fence \nmay make sense. In some places, Border Patrol on horses makes sense. In \nsome places, we have high grasses. Put a Border Patrol officer up on a \nhorse and he can see for miles and miles. That makes sense.\n  This and more was included in the proposal that drew 54 votes. It is \nthe kind of thing we ought to do. It doesn't cost $25 billion, but it \nwill be cost-effective and make our border more secure.\n  I have great affection for our colleague from Tennessee. I appreciate \nhis encouraging tone that this is not the end. What did Churchill say \nwhen he got bounced out of office at end of World War II? He was asked \n6 months after the war, when he really carried Britain through on his \nback. The war is over. He gets beaten. He is asked by a reporter after \nhe lost: For you, Mr. Churchill, is this the end?\n  He said: It is not the end. It is not the beginning of the end. It is \nthe end of the beginning.\n  I hope this is the end of the beginning--maybe with the help of God \nand maybe with a little bit better leadership from the folks down at \n1600.\n  The last thing is this. The Department of Homeland Security--which I \nworked for years to strengthen, to make something we can all be proud \nof--apparently has put out a statement today. I asked to read it. I am \ntold by all kinds of people that it is riddled with inaccuracies and \nfalsehoods. I am going to read it tonight on the way going home. I hope \nthat is not true. What we need to operate here is the truth.\n  I will close with the words of Thomas Jefferson: If the people know \nthe truth, we will not make a mistake. I heard that what the Department \nof Homeland Security put out today was not truthful. It is hard, with \nthat kind of information, to do the right thing.\n  I wish to thank my colleague for giving me this much time and for \nbeing so patient with me. We will be back here in 10 days or so, and we \nwill have a chance to reconnect and see if we can pull a victory out of \nthe jaws of defeat.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding."], "Mr. VAN HOLLEN": ["2018-02-05", "  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize John Brewer \nand his excellent service as a part of our team. Going into my first \nterm as Senator, I was proud to be the first Maryland Senator in almost \n100 years to serve in the Senate Agriculture Committee. Understanding \nthe importance of this role, John hit the ground running as our USDA \nfellow. With his past experience in both public and private sectors, \nJohn leaned into every project, from advocating on behalf of land grant \nuniversities to funding nutrition programs, with great enthusiasm that \nstemmed from his dedication to serve the needs of Marylanders. Besides \nhis vast expertise, we will miss his kindness and dedication. Although \nwe wish we didn't have to give him back to the Department of \nAgriculture, my whole staff and I know he will continue to achieve \ngreat things.\n"], "Mr. REED": ["2018-03-07", "  Mr. REED. Madam President, when we passed the Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act, we did so in response to a financial crisis \nthat shook the foundations of our economy and devastated so many of our \nhard-working constituents. For example, the Dow Jones dropped from an \naverage of 13,677.89 in July of 2007 to an average of 7,235.47 in March \nof 2009, resulting in a 47.1 percent loss. Nationally, the unemployment \nrate increased from 5 percent in January 2008 to 10 percent in October \n2009, and in Rhode Island, the unemployment rate was even higher, \nincreasing from 6.2 percent in January 2008 to 11.9 percent in December \n2009.\n  In short, we had to do something to respond and avoid another \nfinancial crisis because behind each of these harrowing numbers were \nour constituents and their families, who saw their life savings, their \njobs, and their homes evaporate in a flash. That something was the Wall \nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as the Dodd-Frank \nAct.\n  I am proud to have drafted and supported several of its provisions, \nsuch as the creation of a consumer watchdog--the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, the CFPB--whose primary focus has been on protecting \nconsumers from unscrupulous financial activities; my bipartisan \nlanguage calling for a dedicated Office of Servicemember Affairs at the \nCFPB, which helps ensure that our servicemembers and their families are \nprotected in the consumer finance space in the same way these service \nmen and women protect us. That is now a part of the CFPB, and it has \ndone remarkable work protecting the men and women of our armed \nservices, who do remarkable work protecting us.\n  Also , I was able to provide an additional $1 billion in funding \nthrough the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which provided targeted \nemergency assistance to help local communities acquire, redevelop, or \ndemolish foreclosed properties.\n  Frankly, in the wake of the crisis, every city and many rural areas \nwere seeing foreclosed properties sitting there, reminding us all of \nthe devastation. With these resources, they could be repurposed for \nfamilies to live in, or if they were decrepit, they could be demolished \nfor urban development and economic development in rural areas.\n  These are just a handful of the many good and worthwhile provisions \nin the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, but, like any \nother major piece of legislation, it was not perfect.\n  Years ago, the custom here was that we would come together and agree \non technical fixes to comprehensive legislation. It was almost \npredictable that after we had a complex piece of legislation, we would \ndiscover unintended consequences, and we would come together on a \nbipartisan basis to fix those technical issues without having to \nrelitigate the entire bill.\n  Unfortunately, that moment to make needed fixes never happened, and \nwhile the legislation before us today makes changes to the Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act, I am concerned that this \nlegislation may actually go too far and go beyond the needed technical \nfixes. For example, I worry that this legislation may actually make it \ntougher for community banks and credit unions to compete against the \nlarger financial institutions despite the regulatory relief provisions \nin this bill for smaller financial institutions. This is because the \nlegislation encourages large financial institutions to grow even \nlarger--from $50 billion up to $250 billion. It does so, in part, by \nremoving some of the extra oversight provisions we put in place with \nthe Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, such as making sure \nlarge banks undergo strong and robust stress tests to ensure that they \nhave their own sufficient rainy day fund and that any type of problem \nis not funded by taxpayer bailouts.\n\n  In addition, this legislation may further encourage larger financial \ninstitutions to grow by increasing their competitive edge for the kinds \nof businesses and customers currently served by community banks and \ncredit unions, which should be concerning to all who support our \nsmaller local financial institutions. Larger institutions can absorb \nmore costs than smaller institutions. They can have programs that cost \nthem a lot in the short run but drive out the competition in the medium \nand long run. Because they can stretch costs over bigger institutions, \nthey can provide services that might be better provided or more \npersonally provided by smaller institutions, but these will be pushed \nout of the marketplace. So the potential net result of this bill, \nironically, may make it more difficult for regulators to spot a threat \nto financial stability from a larger bank while increasing competitive \npressures on community banks and credit unions.\n  To address some of these concerns, I have filed several amendments to \nimprove the bill and add needed protections for consumers. Let me \ndescribe some of these amendments in greater detail.\n  One amendment seeks to prioritize regulatory relief for institutions \nwith a strong history of doing right by their customers. In the \nlegislation before us, Federal financial regulators are given the \ndiscretion to provide regulatory relief to certain financial \ninstitutions, and in so doing, to consider factors they deem \nappropriate. My amendment simply directs the regulators, when \nexercising this discretion, to also consider whether the financial \ninstitution, in the preceding 24-month period, paid any Federal fines \nor penalties and to consider whether there was any violation or \nsettlement related to an alleged violation of the Servicemembers Civil \nRelief Act--the SCRA--or the Military Lending Act and if these \nviolations could have been avoided. Again, that is a strong emphasis on \nprotecting the men and women who protect us--our servicemembers. These \ntwo pieces of legislation, the SCRA--the Servicemembers Civil Relief \nAct--and the Military Lending Act, are the strongest protections our \nservicemen and women have against financial abuse by institutions.\n  In short, how well an institution serves its customers, including our \nservicemembers, should help determine whether certain financial \ninstitutions deserve the regulatory relief provided under the bill.\n  On a very strong bipartisan basis, I hope we can adopt this \namendment. It just seems so clear to me that when we are giving relief, \nwe should give it to those who have earned it--those institutions that \nhave treated our service men and women well and have treated their \ncustomers well.\n  Another amendment I filed would empower the CFPB and its Office of \nServicemember Affairs to enforce existing SCRA safeguards--the \nServicemembers Civil Relief Act safeguards--such as those that protect \nour servicemembers from being overcharged. This amendment is needed \nbecause, despite the importance of the SCRA's protections to our \nservicemembers, enforcement of this critical law has been inconsistent \nand subject to the discretion\n\n\nof our financial regulators, which can change with each Administration.\n  According to a July 2012 report from the Government Accountability \nOffice, the estimated percentage of depository institutions that \nserviced mortgages that were examined for SCRA compliance varied \nwidely, ranging from rates of 4 percent in 2007, 17 percent in 2008, 18 \npercent in 2009, 26 percent in 2010, and then dropping down to 15 \npercent in 2011. You can see that sort of tracked with the financial \ncrisis, where at a point after 2007 and 2008, the regulators understood \nthe threats that were being posed to service men and women in terms of \ntheir mortgage obligations. But that seems to be fading. We can't lose \nfocus on protecting the men and women who serve us.\n  As someone who has had the experience and privilege of leading \nsoldiers as an executive officer of a paratrooper company, I spent a \nlot of time trying to explain to people who were trying to collect from \nmen and women in uniform that they couldn't because the law had set \ncertain interest rates that they exceeded and that they couldn't \nbecause they were violating--back then it was called the Soldiers' and \nSailors' Civil Relief Act. We need an agency of the government, not \nindividual members of the Armed Forces, to protect these men and women. \nI think that is what we are trying to do with this legislation.\n  Simply put, prioritizing the consumer protection of our service men \nand women should not be discretionary; it should be mandatory. This \namendment ensures that the SCRA enforcement will be permanently a \npriority of the CFPB and the Office of Servicemember Affairs. It is \nsupported by more than 30 organizations, including the National \nMilitary Family Association, Military Officers Association of America, \nVeterans Education Success, Student Veterans of America, and the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States.\n  We also need to do more to protect student loan borrowers. There is a \ngrowing private market to refinance student loans, including Federal \nstudent loans. I filed an amendment to require lenders to disclose the \nbenefits that borrowers might forfeit, such as income-driven repayment \nplans, loan forgiveness, and deferment options, when they refinance a \nFederal loan into a private loan.\n\n  I have also filed an amendment to clarify that the Education Loan \nOmbudsman at the CFPB should monitor and report student loan complaints \nfor all education loans, including Federal student loans.\n  Additionally, I support Senator Durbin's amendment to strengthen \nstudent loan servicing and protections for private student loan \nborrowers and to provide greater transparency and accountability for \ncampus-based banking products beyond just credit cards. We have all \nread about the many abuses that have taken place, and we owe it to \nconsumers everywhere to ensure that these abuses are detected and \nprevented.\n  Continuing this focus on consumer protections, another of my \namendments responds to the difficulties that Rhode Islanders face when \ntrying to secure a loan modification by taking greater advantage of \nbank branches. If you are able to walk into a bank branch and get a \nmortgage, then you should also be able to walk into the same branch and \nget help to avoid preventable foreclosures. What we found in the crisis \nwas that often this was not the case. They could get a loan at the \nbranch, but if they needed any type of assistance, they had to call a \nservicer or go someplace else. My amendment, which is supported by the \nNational Consumer Law Center and the National Association of REALTORS, \nestablishes a pilot program to see whether this would be feasible--\nwhether we could get bank branches not only to make loans but also to \nhelp borrowers when they come into difficult circumstances.\n  I have also filed an amendment that would direct GAO to conduct a \nretrospective study of the impact of the provisions of this legislation \non economic growth and consumer protection. Specifically, my amendment \nasks GAO to evaluate the bill's impact on non-managerial wages, senior \nexecutive pay, stock buybacks, the interest paid on savings or money \nmarket accounts, jobs being moved abroad, foreclosure rates, and \nenforcement actions.\n  In so doing, we will be able to determine whether the legislation \nactually delivers on the claims by its sponsors of economic growth and \nconsumer protection. I think we always have to go back and check our \nwork, and this provision would allow us, in a formal and systematic \nway, to check our work. I hope we can do that.\n  Finally, I have filed an amendment supported by the former Federal \nReserve Chairman, Paul Volcker, to retain and strengthen the Federal \nReserve's emergency safety and soundness powers. To quote Chairman \nVolcker: ``It's clear that circumstances can arise where the activities \nof some banks with less than $250 billion in assets would pose a grave \nthreat to financial stability. To address such a threat, regulators \nhave certain tools in their arsenal that we wish they will never have \nto use. Senator Reed's amendment wisely restores and strengthens one \nsuch tool, allowing it to be deployed under limited circumstances and \nonly upon approval of a supermajority of the [Financial Stability \nOversight] Council.''\n  Surely, at the very least, we should agree to preserve and strengthen \nthe ability of our financial regulators to avoid grave threats and \nanother financial crisis.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to make one further observation. Ten \nyears ago today, few of us knew ahead of time that we would see an \neconomy that would collapse into depths that we did not anticipate, \nthat our Nation would literally recoil due to the recklessness and \nunchecked greed of too many on Wall Street. We should not forget that, \nnationally, over 8.6 million jobs were lost between January 2008 and \nJanuary 2010, with over 33,000 jobs lost in Rhode Island alone. If \nanything, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was a \nsensible and long overdue response to the reality that people are \nnowhere near perfect and cannot always be trusted to do the right \nthing.\n  We learned in the hardest and most painful ways that certain \nsafeguards are necessary. Unfortunately, the bill before us today \nremoves some of those safeguards. Absent any serious changes made to \nthe bill during this week's debate and for all the reasons I have \nstated, I cannot support it.\n  I yield the floor."], "Ms. CORTEZ MASTO": ["2018-03-08", "  Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, I stand today in support of my \ncolleague from Maryland as the 36th State to ratify the Equal Rights \nAmendment. I couldn't agree more. I think it is time to eradicate \ndiscrimination of any kind, so I commend my colleague for standing up \ntoday and for his comments.\n  Mr. President, I stand to talk about an issue that continues in our \ncommunities, and it is the issue of housing discrimination.\n  I recently read an article from the Center for Investigative \nJournalism about a young woman named Rachelle. At the time, Rachelle \nwas in her early thirties and living in Philadelphia. She was making \n$60,000 a year as a contractor at Rutgers University. She had savings, \ngood credit, and an undergraduate degree from Northwestern.\n  When she first went to apply for a home loan, she thought she would \nbe the perfect applicant. On paper, it seemed that way, but a few weeks \nlater, she received an email informing her that her application had \nbeen denied.\n  In the email her broker told her that because she was a contractor \nand not a full-time employee, her application was too risky for the \nbank to approve. She was at a loss. She had been planning to purchase a \nhome for years and thought she had done everything right. She then \nasked her partner, Hanako, to sign on to the application with her. At \nthe time, Hanako was working a few hours a week at the grocery store \nmaking $300 a month. That is about $3,600 a year. Hanako tried calling \nthe bank to speak to a loan officer about the application, and to \nRachelle's surprise, the loan officer picked up. He was attentive, \nhelpful, and friendly to Hanako. A few weeks later, he approved the \ncouple's loan.\n  This makes no sense, right? Rachelle was making an income in the \nupper five figures, $60,000 a year. She was the one with good credit, \nand she was the one paying for Hanako's health insurance. The \ndifference here was that Rachelle was Black.\n  This story did not take place in 1930, when it was legal for housing \nlenders to discriminate on the basis of race. It did not take place in \n1968, the year banks were formally banned from using race as a factor \nin deciding home loan applications. It took place less than 2 years \nago, in 2016.\n  Today, 50 years after the passage of the Fair Housing Act, stories \nlike Rachelle's are all too common. For any person of color who has \ntried to navigate the housing market, Rachelle's experience is a case \nof deja vu.\n  We now know that Rachelle was the victim of redlining. ``Redlining'' \nis a term that describes the practice of denying goods or services to \npeople on the basis of the color of their skin.\n  The term originated in the 1930s, when redlining was the official \npolicy of the Federal Housing Administration. Back then, Federal \nofficials divvied up cities and assigned a color to each neighborhood. \nThe color system was supposed to help mortgage lenders know where to \ninvest. Green and blue neighborhoods were home to desirable borrowers \nwith good credit. Yellow or red meant risky borrowers lived here so \ndon't invest. The practice became known as redlining because the FHA \nwould draw red lines on city maps to designate ``bad'' neighborhoods. \nFor the FHA, a bad neighborhood was defined by the color of one's skin.\n  Redlining was banned in the 1960s, but as we learn from stories like \nRachelle's, the practice still goes on under the radar; so much so that \nin 1975, Congress passed the Housing Mortgage Disclosure Act--HMDA--to \nhelp regulators identify when it was going on, but even with the new \nrequirements, redlining continued.\n  Then, in the 1990s, the financial industry began selling something \ncalled the subprime loan. Subprime loans have high fees, adjustable \ninterest rates, and payment shocks--characteristics that made them \nextremely dangerous. People who weren't approved for traditional loans \nwere offered subprime loans instead.\n  In 2008, when the market crashed, subprime loan holders saw their \ninterest rates skyrocket. They suddenly became unable to afford to stay \nin their homes. Who do you think was most likely to hold one of these \nso-called subprime mortgages? People living in redlined neighborhoods, \npeople of color, people who had been denied access to traditional \nloans.\n  My home State of Nevada was one of the hardest hit States in the \ncountry by the financial crisis. We had the highest foreclosure rates \nfor 62 straight months. We had the most number of underwater mortgages, \nand over 219,000 families lost their homes.\n  Anyone driving through parts of Las Vegas and Reno in 2009 could see \nboarded up houses, for sale signs, and empty lots everywhere. On many \nstreets, you would see more houses in foreclosure than not, and while \nall neighborhoods suffered, African-American, Latino, and Asian-Pacific \nIslander communities were hit the hardest. Entire neighborhoods were \nhollowed out. Trillions of dollars were lost.\n  I was the attorney general of Nevada at this time. We did everything \nwe could to fight for homeowners and help them stay in their homes. As \nthis was going on, I asked myself: How could this happen? The Federal \nGovernment was supposed to regulate these banks. Where were they? Why \ndidn't they put a stop to these practices before it all came crashing \ndown? The Federal Government was supposed to be the watchdog, but they \nwere letting banks write their own rules.\n  As attorney general of Nevada, I sued the big banks for their \nfraudulent practices and secured over $1.9 billion to help homeowners \nin my State.\n\n\n  In 2010, Federal lawmakers passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \nand Consumer Protection Act to ensure that what we saw in 2008 would \nnever happen again. The bill was not perfect, but it did a lot of \nthings right.\n  It strengthened oversight of the big banks. It made the big banks \nundergo stress tests and develop bankruptcy plans, and it also \nstrengthened HMDA, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. It strengthened \nreporting requirements to help regulators fight back against \ndiscriminatory, racist, redlining practices.\n  Banks say they don't treat borrowers differently, but the data shows \nus that is a different story. Redlining remains a major problem for \ncommunities of color.\n  The legislation we are now considering, S. 2155, would roll back Wall \nStreet reform. It includes a section, section 104, that would repeal \nmany of the reporting requirements we added after the financial crisis \nto prevent housing discrimination. Some rural and low-income census \ntracks are predominantly served by small lenders.\n  If this specific loan data is removed from them, government \nofficials, researchers, and the public will not have information on the \nquality of loans made, nor will they know about the credit scores of \nthe borrowers or even a way to easily track the loans after they are \nsold to investors.\n  When I was attorney general, I needed the information on the quality \nof the loans in the State to protect consumers.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday we held a hearing on \nChina in Africa. The hearing analyzed China's activity and engagement \nin sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, we looked into what motivates \nChina and how Chinese involvement has affected African countries.\n   While a number of African nations have welcomed Chinese engagement \nand investment, it often comes at a cost: a focus on extractive \nindustries, entanglement with a neo-mercantilist trade policy and a \ntendency to adopt ``worst practices'' that prop up kleptocrats and \nautocrats--such as the DR Congo's Joseph Kabila--while fueling \ncorruption in an effort to win contracts.\n   China's engagement in Africa once was driven by revolutionary \nideology, motivated by competition with the Soviet Union as much as it \nwas directed at ``capitalist roaders'' aligned with the United States. \nIn Angola, for example, in 1975, Soviet-backed Communists bested \nChinese-backed revolutionary rivals, including Jonas Savimbi, who was a \nMaoist before he was reborn in the 1980s as an anti-Communist freedom \nfighter.\n   Today, China's one-time Marxist-Leninist-Maoist impulse has been \nsoftened to the point of almost--but not quite--disappearing, with \nrevolution replaced by infrastructure projects, trade missions, soft \nloans and scholarships for promising African students.\n   While on the one hand Africa needs investment and it needs \ninfrastructure, we see a worrisome trend of African countries sliding \ninto indebtedness to China, accumulating burdens that may be beyond \ntheir capacity to meet.\n   All too often, the roads China builds are meant to allow it access \nto mineral resources that it can extract and ship to China, or are part \nof its ``One-Belt, One-Road'' initiative which is designed to benefit \nChina, ultimately, and help it project power. Further, as anyone who \nhas been to Africa has observed, these grand construction projects \noften utilize Chinese engineers and workers, not Africans.\n   As we heard yesterday from the witnesses, nowhere in Africa is the \nproblem of indebtedness more pronounced than in Djibouti--a \nstrategically important country in the Horn of Africa which sits \nastride the Mandeb Strait, and one of only five African countries which \nSecretary of State Tillerson is visiting on his trip to Africa this \nweek.\n   A former French colony, Djibouti hosts a French military base, and \nan American one at Camp Lemonnier. And, since last summer, Djibouti \nalso hosts China's only permanent military base outside of China. Query \nwhether that concession, fraught with geopolitical implications, is \nlinked to leverage China is able to exert due to Djibouti's \nvulnerability on indebtedness.\n   China's overall foreign aid and financial leverage on the continent \nhas been difficult to quantify, as has demonstrating how that \ntranslates into influence. Yeoman work in this regard has been done by \nAidData at the College of William & Mary which, in written testimony \nthat was submitted as part of the record today, demonstrates a \ncorrelation with how an African country votes at the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly with how much aid it receives from China.\n   Another strategically important country with high indebtedness to \nChina that the Secretary will visit is Ethiopia. It is also a country \nwhere China has most clearly aligned itself with repressive forces. In \naddition to assisting the government in controlling information flows, \nsuch as via signal jamming of Voice of American and BBC broadcasts, the \nChinese Communist Party has engaged with Ethiopia's ruling party on \n``training and exchanges.''\n   As the Brookings Institution has documented, cadres from the ruling \nEthiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front ``were taught \ncomprehensively how to manage their own organizational structure, \nideological work, propaganda system, [and] cadre education.''\n   Thus, it seems ideology still matters with regard to how China \nengages Africa. It is no coincidence that Ethiopia has become one of \nthe most repressive regimes on the continent, and the subject of a \nHouse resolution focused on Ethiopia's abusive practices that Ms. Bass \nand I have sponsored, H. Res. 128. Whereas the U.S. emphasizes good \ngovernance, it suits China's interest to train its partners in old-\nstyle Leninism.\n   We also heard from one of our witnesses on how China projects power \nin the form of Confucius Institutes located in close to forty African \nnations. This subcommittee has held hearings on how China in our own \ncountry and elsewhere uses these Institutes to push a Sinocentric \nnarrative which aligns with Communist Party propaganda and curtails \nacademic freedom.\n   In addition to utilizing Confucius Institutes to train Mandarin \nspeakers and indoctrinate students with a pro-China world view, China \nis expanding its media presence in Africa. Kenya is the country with \nthe largest penetration of Chinese media and the highest level of brand \nrecognition, according to our Broadcasting Board of Governors, which \noversees the Voice of America and which recently conducted a survey of \nChina's media presence in Africa. It should be noted that of five major \ninternational networks in Kenya, China's news broadcasts were the least \ntrusted.\n   Here also is a thought for Voice of America and the Broadcasting \nBoard of Governors to consider--add Mandarin programming to the \nrepertoire of languages in which you broadcast in Africa. By \nbroadcasting objective news stories in Mandarin, you will expose not \nonly African students learning Mandarin to more truthful media, but you \nwill be able to reach the estimated million or so Chinese living or \nworking in Africa with news that they are otherwise unable to access.\n   China is also Kenya's largest bilateral lender, and one of the three \nhighest debtor nations to China in Africa, along with Djibouti and \nEthiopia. It is also a country where Secretary Tillerson will be \nvisiting. On his trip, he may want to highlight the following anecdote, \nwhich I believe aptly contrasts China's Africa engagement with that of \nthe United States.\n   Health commodities supplied by USAID, including life-saving anti-\nretrovirals distributed as part of our PEPFAR program and anti-malarial \ncommodities, used to be shipped to and stored in a warehouse near \nNairobi for distribution not only throughout Kenya, but also in \nneighboring East African countries as well.\n   Then in July 2013, Kenya's parliament imposed a 1.5 per cent levy on \nall imports to Kenya to help pay for a nearly $4 billion railroad from \nthe port of Mombasa to Nairobi built by the state-owned China Road and \nBridge Corporation. Donated goods--including anti-retrovirals for \nKenyans living with HIV/AIDS--were subject to this levy to help pay \nKenya's debt to China.\n   As a result of this, the flow of life-saving commodities into Kenya \nand neighboring countries was burdened and slowed. Kenya's Ministry of \nHealth offered to step in and pay the levy, but their payments were \noften delayed by some two months. Meanwhile, demurrage charges \nattributable to clearance delays continued to accrue, and had to be \npaid by the U.S. taxpayer.\n   Ultimately, over a year later, Kenya's parliament amended the \nlegislation to exclude donated goods from the Chinese railway-payment \nlevy, but the damage had been done. Today, due to this experience and \nother factors related to logistics and a new USAID implementing \npartner, USAID no longer uses a warehouse in Kenya. Storage and \ndistribution has been moved offshore, to a location less-\n\n\ncentrally located but one hopes less prone to disruption.\n   How did this warehouse episode, borne out of Kenya's need to repay \ndebt to China, benefit Kenyans suffering from HIV/AIDS? How did it \naffect the ability of Kenya to serve as a regional distribution hub for \nEast Africa, with all the collateral economic benefits that accrue from \nthis purely humanitarian initiative paid for by U.S. taxpayers? More \nbroadly, where is China's PEPFAR, or the equivalent of the President's \nMalaria Initiative?\n   These are questions which Africa's leaders, and the African people, \nneed to consider.\n"], "Ms. ADAMS": ["2018-01-16", "  Ms. ADAMS.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize February as \nNational Marfan Awareness Month with the hope that increased awareness \nof Marfan syndrome and related heritable connective tissue disorders \nwill save lives.\n  Marfan syndrome is a rare genetic condition. About 1 in 5,000 \nAmericans carries a mutation in a gene called fibrillin-l which results \nin an overproduction of a protein called transforming growth factor \nbeta, or TGFB. The increased TGFB impacts connective tissue and, since \nconnective tissue is found throughout the body, Marfan syndrome \nfeatures can manifest almost anywhere. Patients often have \ndisproportionately long limbs, a protruding or indented chest bone, \ncurved spine, and loose joints. However, it is not the outward signs \nthat concern Marfan syndrome patients, but the effects the condition \nhas on the body's internal systems. Most notably, the aorta, which is \nthe large artery that carries blood away from the heart, is weakened \nand prone to enlargement and potentially fatal rupture.\n  An early and accurate diagnosis, regular monitoring, and medical \ninterventions are necessary to prevent cardiac events. This is why I \nbelieve it is important to develop a program to support, assist, and \nencourage states to incorporate Marfan syndrome testing into their \nsports screening criteria for at-risk young athletes. Few states \ninclude Marfan syndrome testing in their sports screening for high \nschool athletes which leads to Marfan syndrome-related thoracic aortic \naneurysm and dissection, claiming the lives of young athletes across \nthe country each year.\n  I am proud to know the nation's foremost organization working to \nsupport the Marfan community, the Marfan Foundation, through their \nstrong advocacy work on Capitol Hill. The Foundation was founded in \n1981 and has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of individuals \naffected by Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue disorders by \nadvancing research, raising awareness, and providing support.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with me and reflect on the work that \nneeds to be done to ensure that patients with rare conditions can \nexpect to see sustained and meaningful improvements in their health and \ncare over the next 30 years. I urge my colleagues to stand with me and \nrecognize National Marfan Awareness Month.\n\n\n"], "Mr. MITCHELL": ["2018-02-26", "  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for joining me this \nevening.\n  Mr. Speaker, I did want to, at this point, wrap up this evening's \nversion of the Tax Truth Squad.\n  Since the tax reform bill was passed and signed into law, let me \nstate again that more than 400 companies have given a pay raise; \nbonuses; increased 401(k) contributions; or, in the case of utilities, \nlowered rates--lowered rates dramatically.\n  At least 4 million Americans are receiving special tax reform \nbonuses. Direct bonus announcements have already topped $3 billion; $3 \nbillion into our economy, into people's pockets, decisions they can \nmake about what they want to do with the money rather than turning it \nover to the government, rather than turning it over to the IRS, rather \nthan having it spent on bureaucracy.\n  In my home district, we will talk about that more next week, but I \nwant to reference that Fiat Chrysler is moving jobs here from Mexico, \nmoving to Macomb County, investing $1 billion--yes, you heard that \nright, investing $1 billion--in expanding a plant and creating 2,500 \nnew jobs in Michigan just in that one plant.\n  By the way, they also announced a bonus--a tax bonus separate from \ntheir bonus in their contract, which some people said: Oh, it was in \ntheir contract.\n  No, it wasn't. It was a bonus of $2,000 per employee as a result of \nthe tax bill.\n  These are major cuts that people overlook. Look at these companies, \nlook at the list of them, and it grows every day.\n  Let me suggest real quickly: I don't know about you, Mr. Speaker, but \nI know my district and I know my constituents, and $1,000 is not \ncrumbs.\n  I referenced earlier the note I got over the weekend from Mark in my \ndistrict who says his projected taxes next year save him $2,700 in his \npocket.\n  Now, I know where you live, I know where I live, that is real money. \nMaybe for some of my colleagues, it doesn't matter as much, but that is \nwhy we passed this bill. That is why we worked so hard on this bill. \nThat is why we support it. And that is the truth about taxes.\n  That is what we want the American people to understand: we are \nputting money back in their pockets, money back in the economy, rather \nthan taking money and putting it in government and hoping they do \nsomething productive with it.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity this evening.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n"], "Mr. ROUNDS": ["2018-03-07", "  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the Economic \nGrowth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act which is being \nconsidered on the Senate floor for this week. As a member of the Senate \nBanking Committee, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this \nimportant legislation which will provide much needed regulatory relief \nto our community banks and credit unions whose ability to serve their \ncustomers has been made more difficult since the passage of the Dodd-\nFrank Act.\n  Enacted in 2010, Dodd-Frank was an overreaction to the 2008 financial \ncrisis. Rather than actually addressing the underlying issues that \ncaused the financial crisis, Dodd-Frank created a massive new \nbureaucracy and saddled our financial institutions with burdensome and \nonerous new regulations. It is 2,300 pages in length and created more \nthan 400 new rulemakings, which led to 27,000 new Federal mandates on \nAmerican businesses. This limits the ability of our financial \ninstitutions to grow and serve their customers, especially for smaller \nbanks in rural areas such as in my home State of South Dakota.\n  Just last summer, the U.S. Department of Treasury reported that the \nregulatory burdens of Dodd-Frank have reduced economic growth and \n``undermined the ability of banks to deliver attractively priced credit \nin sufficient quantity to meet the needs of the economy.''\n  Without question, no one wants to repeat the events that contributed \nto the economic recession that began in 2008. We are only now beginning \nto lift out of that nearly decade-long economic slump, thanks to the \ntax relief law and President Trump's focus on regulatory reform.\n  Just in the last year, we have enacted historic tax reform, we have \nundone burdensome and unnecessary regulations at a record pace, and we \nare restoring the American people's confidence at levels not seen in \ndecades, but we must do more, which is why our bipartisan legislation \nis so important.\n  Making sure American families and businesses have access to credit \nwhen they need it is critical as we work to grow our economy and create \njobs. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection \nAct will strengthen America's financial system and expand economic \nopportunities across the entire country, especially in rural areas \nwhich are often the most underserved.\n  Of the many fatal flaws of Dodd-Frank, perhaps most damaging was its \none-size-fits-all approach. By taking a one-size-fits-all approach, \nDodd-Frank imposed disproportionate compliance costs on our smaller \ncommunity banks and credit unions, especially given the improbability \nthat these smaller institutions pose a significant risk to our \nfinancial system. This type of approach is particularly harmful to our \nsmaller financial institutions which are so vital to our communities.\n  With more than 6,500 community banks throughout the country \nsupporting even the remotest areas, we must make certain we are helping \nand not hindering their ability to serve their communities.\n  Almost half of small businesses, which we all know are the drivers of \njob creation and economic growth in America, are supported by small \ncommunity banks. Providing these institutions with regulatory relief is \ncritical, which is what our legislation does.\n  Let me go through some of the highlights, which include seven \nprovisions or bills I introduced. It includes the Home Mortgage \nDisclosure Adjustment Act, which I introduced with Senator Heitkamp \nearlier this year, and will provide small banks and credit unions with \ndata reporting relief.\n\n\n  We also provide relief from Dodd-Frank capital rules that allow banks \nto count high-quality municipal bonds toward capital requirements, \nproviding help to both banks and local units of government that issue \nthat debt. In other words, those banks can now make a market for those \nmunicipal bonds once again.\n  Our legislation also streamlines Federal rules to help small, local \nFederal savings associations, known as FSA's or thrifts, expand their \nability to offer loans to more families and businesses without going \nthrough a costly charter conversion process.\n  It also includes parts of the Community Bank Access to Capital Act, \nwhich would free small banks from having to complete arduous and \nexpensive tests which are already mandated by Dodd-Frank, and it makes \nit easier for banks with less than $3 billion in assets to raise \ncapital and grow.\n  I am also pleased it includes my provision to protect the credit of \nour Nation's veterans, so veterans waiting on delayed payments from the \nVA Choice Program cannot lose their credit ratings because of it. It is \na sad commentary when you have to make a law in the financial \ninstitutions section of the code to take care of veterans because the \nVA cannot pay their bills on time.\n  It also protects seniors by removing liability for financial services \ninstitutions and professionals reporting suspected fraud of senior \ncitizens to the authorities. We also provide relief to small public \nhousing agencies by reducing regulatory burdens on and increasing \nflexibility for these entities.\n  This bill also provides rural appraisal relief for cases when buyers \nhave trouble finding a qualified appraiser. The reason for this is \nbecause if you want to get a home loan, one of the requirements under \nDodd-Frank is that you have to have a qualified appraiser actually \nappraise the home, regardless of where you live. What this provision \ndoes is it relaxes some of those rules with regard to where the amounts \non a mortgage can be, less than a particular amount as specified in our \nbill, and still be a qualified mortgage so banks can move them on to \nthe secondary market. That helps to create a market for those \nmortgages, making it easier for a consumer to actually access that \ncredit.\n  Our bill also gives the Federal Reserve flexibility in designating \nbanks as systemically important, exempting banks with less than $100 \nbillion in assets from several Dodd-Frank provisions that apply to \nsystemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, including \nreporting requirements, limits on lending, and limits on mergers and \nacquisitions.\n  Also banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion would \nreceive relief from tighter oversight applied by Dodd-Frank. This would \nexempt 15 regional and midsized banks from these more stringent rules. \nMeanwhile, more than a dozen of our country's largest banks will still \nhave to comply with the SIFI requirements. These are the largest \nfinancial institutions.\n  We also eliminate barriers to jobs by allowing mortgage loan \noriginators to work temporarily in a new State or for a new financial \ninstitution while their applications for new licenses are pending. Our \nbill also requires the Treasury to study and report on the risks of \ncyber threats to our financial institutions and capital markets.\n  Finally, our bill provides regulatory relief from enhanced \nsupplementary leverage ratio for certain banks that service \norganizations like mutual funds and State and local pension plans. It \ndoesn't hardly seem appropriate that we would make our banks less \ncompetitive than foreign banks for providing that same service. Let's \nkeep that opportunity and that market within our own borders as well. \nLet's allow them to be competitive, which saves on costs for mutual \nfund purchasers.\n  This benefits countless local governments across the country that do \nbusiness with these banks. In my home State alone, this includes the \nState of South Dakota, the South Dakota Retirement System, the Rapid \nCity Regional Hospital, the city of Vermillion, and the Watertown \nSchool District, just to name a few of them. While this provision will \nnot help all banks, it will affect some banks, which benefits \nconsumers, and in the future perhaps we can give the same relief to all \nbanks that offer these important services.\n  These provisions, along with the many others of our bill, will \nstrengthen our financial system in the United States and reduce the \nunnecessary burdens on small or midsized banks so they can focus on \nserving their communities, not complying with layers of bureaucracy.\n  Making sure families and businesses have access to credit when they \nneed it is critical as we work to grow a healthy American economy. \nEvery step we can take to provide relief to our lenders is a win for \nfamilies and businesses that rely on them to run their businesses, to \nbuy a home, or to save for college.\n  Small community banks don't think of banking in terms of derivatives \nand default swaps like they do on Wall Street. They think of banking in \nterms of how they can best serve their communities, their friends, \nneighbors, store owners, and job providers. Our bipartisan Economic \nGrowth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act will help these \nlenders focus on doing just exactly that.\n  I thank Chairman Crapo and the other 24 cosponsors of this \nlegislation for their commitment to working together to provide much \nneeded relief that will enhance our ability to grow our economy.\n  I yield the floor."], "Mr. SOTO": ["2018-02-15", "  Mr. SOTO.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In closing, let me just reiterate that this legislation solves two \nproblems. It solves the problem of responsible expansion of access to \nmortgage credit, access to that American Dream of home ownership; and, \nat the same time, preventing the mistakes that led to the 2008 \nfinancial crisis, the originate to distribute model where originators \nof mortgages had no skin in the game and they allowed those mortgages \nto be poorly underwritten or not underwritten at all, with no \ndocumentation, and then securitized and sold into the secondary market, \nreally without any eye towards the consumer and the borrower's ability \nto repay.\n  Everybody in this institution, as evidenced by the bipartisan work \nhere, we all recognize that a borrower should demonstrate an ability to \nrepay that loan, but the crux of this legislation, at the core of this \nlegislation is a recognition that a local community banker, a local \ncredit union, a lender with a personal relationship with a borrower is \nin the best position to determine whether or not that borrower, that \nprospective homeowner, can repay that loan.\n  When there is risk retention, when that lender is charged with the \nresponsibility of maintaining that loan in portfolio, the lender is \nmuch more incentivized to properly underwrite that loan and make sure \nthat that customer, that borrower, that future homeowner, has a \ndemonstrable ability to repay. I think it is a much better substitute \nto a one-size-fits-all credit box from, frankly, bureaucrats in \nWashington, D.C., who have no eye towards the creditworthiness of that \nparticular borrower.\n  We have worked with our friends on the other side of the aisle to \nmake this a bipartisan piece of legislation limiting the size of the \ninstitutions that can access this regulatory relief. But, clearly, when \ncommunity financial institutions, bankers from around the country, \nevery part of the country, are saying that they see the QM rule as not \n``qualified mortgages,'' but as ``quitting mortgages;'' and when we see \nan\n\n\nunnecessary constraint of mortgage credit; and when the National \nAssociation of Realtors are reporting that they are unable to close \nmortgages due to this onerous qualified mortgage rule, clearly the \npendulum has swung too far.\n  So, yes, we needed some reforms in the aftermath of the financial \ncrisis. This QM rule went too far. This is a recalibration of that. And \nthis is important regulatory relief for our community financial \ninstitutions that will inure to the benefit of the American home-buying \npublic, and it will do so in a responsible way, providing a viable \nalternative to the originate to distribute practices that really led to \nthe financial crisis.\n  Madam Speaker, let me just make one final observation, and that is to \ngive credit to the administration. The Department of the Treasury, in \ntheir findings and recommendations in their report on banks and credit \nunions, they recognized that this was a problem in the mortgage lending \nspace and they made a recommendation also to increase the portfolio \nlending safe harbor to institutions with $10 billion in assets or \nlower; and that, as they argued, will accommodate loans made and \nretained by small depository institutions, provide that needed \nregulatory relief to our community financial institutions, and also \nexpand access to mortgage credit in a responsible way.\n  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support. At this time \nI have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime."], "Ms. JACKSON LEE": ["2018-03-08", "  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Evans for anchoring \nthis very important Special Order on the subject of the famous Kerner \nCommission Report and the persistence of economic inequality and \npoverty in America.\n  Together, we stand, firmly committed to combating poverty.\n  Poverty in America reaches into all regions of the country, urban and \nrural, and affects millions of persons of all races, ethnicities, \ncreed, ages, and gender.\n  However, it seems that far too often, and for far too long, the \nAfrican American community has been disproportionately disadvantaged.\n  Three years ago we marked the 50th anniversary of the Watts Rebellion \nin Los Angeles, which was followed in the succeeding two years by the \nlong hot summers and outbreaks of civil unrest in Detroit, Newark, \nWashington, D.C., Baltimore, and Gary, Indiana.\n  The 1967 civil unrest and disturbances in Detroit and Newark prompted \nPresident Lyndon Johnson to establish the National Advisory Commission \non Civil Disorders, an 11-member commission, chaired by Illinois \nGovernor Otto Kerner.\n  The mandate of the Kerner Commission was to identify the underlying \ncause of the civil unrest in communities across the country.\n  On February 29, 1968, following several field trips to troubled \ncommunities, the Commission released its 176-page report that examined \ncultural and institutional racism, from segregated schools and housing \ndiscrimination to generational poverty and limited economic \nopportunity.\n  The Kerner Report brought attention to the racial tension and divide \nthat communities of color were facing nationwide.\n  It is important to recall two of the more important conclusions of \nthe Kerner Report.\n  First, the Commission concluded that:\n  ``Discrimination and segregation have long permeated much of American \nlife; they now threaten the future of every American. This deepening \nracial division is not inevitable. The movement apart can be reversed. \nChoice is still possible. Our principal task is to define that choice \nand to press for a national resolution. To pursue our present course \nwill involve the continuing polarization of the American community and, \nultimately, the destruction of basic democratic values.''\n  Second, the Commission concluded that:\n  ``No American--white or black--can escape the consequences of the \ncontinuing social and economic decay of our major cities. Only a \ncommitment to national action on an unprecedented scale can shape a \nfuture compatible with the historic ideals of American society.''\n  The Kerner Commission called for bold policies to counter decades of \npolitical failure, such as investment in much-needed social services, \nhousing, and education programs and incentivizing diversity among law \nenforcement.\n  In the wake of the upheaval, the Civil Rights Act of 1968 outlawing \nhousing discrimination was signed into law.\n  Consequently, the past 50 years have seen the most progress towards \nequality than any point in our nation's history.\n  Over the last five decades, African Americans have seen substantial \ngains in high school completion rates.\n  High school graduation rates are up to 92.3 percent.\n  College graduation rates have also improved for African Americans.\n  Among 25-29-year-olds, less than one in 10 (9.1 percent) had a \ncollege degree in 1968, a figure that has climbed to almost one in four \n(22.8 percent) today.\n  Over the same period, however, college completion expanded for whites \nat a similar pace, rising from 16.2 percent in 1968 to 42.1 percent \ntoday, leaving the relative situation of African Americans basically \nunchanged: in 1968 African Americans were just over half (56.0 percent) \nas likely as whites to have a college degree, a situation that is \nessentially the same today (54.2 percent).\n  America has made some improvements, but African Americans continue to \nface some of the same obstacles identified in the Kerner Report.\n  The unemployment rate for African Americans in 2017 (the last full \nyear of data) was\n\n\n7.5 percent, 0.8 percentage points higher than it was in 1968 (6.7 \npercent).\n  The unemployment rate for whites was 3.8 percent in 2017 and 3.2 \npercent in 1968.\n  The unemployment data for these two years, almost 50 years apart, \ndemonstrate a longstanding and unfortunate economic regularity: the \nunemployment rate for black workers is consistently about twice as high \nas it is for white workers.\n  Today, hourly wage black workers who could get jobs still only made \n82.5 cents on every dollar earned by the typical white worker.\n  In, 1968, black infants were about 1.9 times as likely to die as \nwhite infants; today, the infant mortality rate is 2.3 times higher for \nAfrican Americans.\n  On average, an African American born today can still expect to live \nabout 3.5 fewer years than a white person born on the same day.\n  In 1968, African Americans were about 5.4 times as likely as whites \nto be in prison or jail; compared to today, African Americans are 6.4 \ntimes as likely as whites to be incarcerated, which is especially \ntroubling given that whites are also much more likely to be \nincarcerated now than they were in 1968.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is clear the inequalities and disparities that \nignited hundreds of American cities in the 1960s still exist and have \nnot been eliminated over the last half-century.\n  Fifty years ago, the Kerner Commission proposed bold recommendations \nto address the issues of poverty and racism that plague the African-\nAmerican community, including:\n  Investmnts in housing programs to combat de facto segregation in \ncommunities;\n  Investments in K-12 and higher education to provide equal access to \nquality education;\n  Investments in job training programs to ensure equal employment \nopportunities.\n  Unfortunately, those recommendations have not been fully heeded over \nthe past half-century.\n  The time has come for Congress to rededicate itself to making bold \ninvestments necessary to eliminate economic inequality of opportunity \nin every corner of our great nation.\n  If these investments are not made, our nation will remain separate \nand unequal for another 50 years.\n  I urge my colleagues in Congress, and all Americans, to look at what \nunites us rather than what divides us.\n  We are linked by our compassion, and bound by the fundamental edict \nof the American Dream that says we will strive to provide our children \nwith a better life than we had.\n  We can, and we must, find the common ground necessary to make this \ndream a reality for Americans of every race and creed, nationality and \nreligion, gender and sexual orientation; indeed for every American \nwherever he or she may live in this great land regardless of what he or \nshe looks like or who they may love.\n"], "Mr. ROTHFUS": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. ROTHFUS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I wonder if my friend from Pennsylvania has really taken a look at \nthe legislation, because there are rules that apply. The entire bevy of \nenvironmental rules apply to these plants, and the SENSE Act is going \nto leave those in place, all the rules.\n  What the SENSE Act does is take a look at two factors--two factors--\nhydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide. That is it. And it says, if you \nare in compliance with hydrogen chloride, you will be deemed to be in \ncompliance with sulfur dioxide, or, conversely, if you are in \ncompliance with sulfur dioxide, you will be deemed in compliance with \nhydrogen chloride. Everything else is applicable. Everything else is \napplicable.\n  This is why I talk about a customization for a small handful of the \nplants. The group that represents these plants supports this \nlegislation. The workers in these plants support this legislation. The \npeople who live next to these coal piles support this legislation.\n  But to suggest that this legislation means no rules for these plants \nis just not accurate. All the rules apply to these plants. We are \nseeing a small tweak because, again, when you look at the economics of \nrunning a business, running a plant, you are looking at cost; and if \nyou are going to impose the cost to put the additional mechanics within \nthe plant, it is not going to happen. Those plants are going to close. \nThat is what we are looking at.\n  So, again, I would appreciate if folks who take a look at this \nlegislation understand that these plants are still subject to strict \nregulation both at the Federal and State level and that this is a minor \ntweaking of one rule. While the EPA may have been discussing the \nbenefit of these plants in the context of another rule, the fact \nremains the same: these units warrant special consideration. If it is \ntrue under one rule, it is going to be true under all rules because of, \nagain, the unique environmental benefits that these plants provide."], "The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Norman)": ["2018-01-18", "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Norman).

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5447, The Music \nModernization Act. Mr. Speaker, there is broad, bipartisan agreement \nthat current music licensing laws no longer meet the needs of creators \nand music providers in the digital age. Southern California has \nestablished itself as a leader in the entertainment industry, and \nsupporting our artists and music industry is a job creator for my \nconstituents.\n  This bill would address the inefficiencies in the music industry's \nlicensing system by establishing uniformity in the licensing process. \nLicenses will now be managed by one entity which in turn would be paid \nfor by the licensees. In addition to an increase in efficiency, the \nMusic Modernization Act would foster a more transparent relationship \nbetween creators and music platforms. Information regarding music owed \nroyalties would be easily accessible through the database created by \nthe Music Modernization Act. This transparency will surely improve the \nworking relationship between creators and music platforms and aid the \nmusic industry's innovation process.\n  Most importantly, this bill would establish a uniformed rate that \nwould allow song writers and artists to receive fair market pay for \ntheir ideas and creations.\n  As a society, we value the work and products of artists, creators, \nand the music industry.

Mr. President, I have stood in this place many times and \naddressed as ``President'' many Presiding Officers. I have been so \naddressed when I have sat in that chair, and that is as close as I will \never be to a Presidency. It is an honorific we are almost indifferent \ntoo; isn't it? In truth, presiding over the Senate can be a nuisance, a \nbit of a ceremonial bore, and it is usually relegated to the more \njunior Members of the majority.\n  But as I stand here today--looking a little worse for wear, I am \nsure--I have a refreshed appreciation for the protocols and customs of \nthis body and for the other 99 privileged souls who have been elected \nto this Senate.\n  I have been a Member of the U.S. Senate for 30 years. I had another \nlong, if not as long, career before I arrived here, another profession \nthat was profoundly rewarding and in which I had experiences and \nfriendships that I revere. Make no mistake, my service here is the most \nimportant job I have had in my life. I am so grateful to the people of \nArizona for the privilege--for the honor--of serving here and the \nopportunities it gives me to play a small role in the history of the \ncountry I love.\n  I have known and admired men and women in the Senate who played much \nmore than a small role in our history--true statesmen, giants of \nAmerican politics. They came from both parties and from various \nbackgrounds. Their ambitions were frequently in conflict. They held \ndifferent views on the issues of the day. They often had very serious \ndisagreements about how best to serve the national interest.\n  But they knew that however sharp and heartfelt their disputes and \nhowever keen their ambitions, they had an obligation to work \ncollaboratively to ensure the Senate discharged its constitutional \nresponsibilities effectively. Our responsibilities are important--\nvitally important--to the continued success of our Republic. Our arcane \nrules and customs are deliberatively intended to require broad \ncooperation to function well at all. The most revered Members of this \ninstitution accepted the necessity of compromise in order to make \nincremental progress on solving America's problems and to defend her \nfrom her adversaries.\n  That principled mindset and the service of our predecessors who \npossessed it come to mind when I hear the Senate referred to as the \nworld's greatest deliberative body. I am not sure we can claim that \ndistinction with a straight face today. I am sure it wasn't always \ndeserved in previous eras either. I am sure there have been times when \nit was, and I was privileged to witness some of those occasions.\n  Our deliberations today, not just our debates but the exercise of all \nour responsibilities--authorizing government policies, appropriating \nthe funds to implement them, exercising our advice and consent role--\nare often lively and interesting. They can be sincere and principled, \nbut they are more partisan, more tribal more of the time than at any \ntime I can remember. Our deliberations can still be important and \nuseful, but I think we would all agree they haven't been overburdened \nby greatness lately. Right now, they aren't producing much for the \nAmerican people.\n  Both sides have let this happen. Let's leave the history of who shot \nfirst to the historians. I suspect they will find we all conspired in \nour decline, either by deliberate actions or neglect. We have all \nplayed some role in it. Certainly, I have. Sometimes, I have let my \npassion rule my reason. Sometimes I made it harder to find common \nground because of something harsh I said to a colleague. Sometimes I \nwanted to win more for the sake of winning than to achieve a contested \npolicy.\n  Incremental progress, compromises that each side criticizes but also \naccepts, and just plain muddling through to chip away at problems and \nto keep\n\n\nour enemies from doing their worst aren't glamorous or exciting. It \ndoesn't feel like a political triumph. It is usually the most we can \nexpect from our system of government, operating in a country as \ndiverse, quarrelsome, and free as ours.\n  Considering the injustice and cruelties inflicted by autocratic \ngovernments and how corruptible human nature can be, the problem-\nsolving our system does make possible, the fitful progress it produces, \nand the liberty and justice it preserves, are a magnificent \nachievement.\n  Our system doesn't depend on our nobility. It accounts for our \nimperfections and gives an order to our individual strivings that has \nhelped make ours the most powerful and prosperous society on Earth. It \nis our responsibility to preserve that, even when it requires us to do \nsomething less satisfying than winning, even when we must give a little \nto get a little, even when our efforts managed just 3 yards in a cloud \nof dust, while critics on both sides denounced us for timidity, for our \nfailure to triumph.\n  I hope we can again rely on humility, on our need to cooperate, on \nour dependence on each other to learn how to trust each other again \nand, by so doing, better serve the people who elected us. Stop \nlistening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and \nthe internet. To hell with them. They don't want anything done for the \npublic good. Our incapacity is their livelihood.\n\n  Let's trust each other. Let's return to regular order. We have been \nspinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying \nto find a way to win without help from across the aisle. That is an \napproach that has been employed by both sides: mandating legislation \nfrom the top down, without any support from the other side, with all \nthe parliamentary maneuvers it requires. We are getting nothing done, \nmy friends. We are getting nothing done.\n  All we have really done this year is confirm Neil Gorsuch to the \nSupreme Court. Our healthcare insurance system is a mess. We all know \nit, those who support ObamaCare and those who oppose it. Something has \nto be done. We Republicans have looked for a way to end it and replace \nit with something else without paying a terrible political price. We \nhaven't found it yet. I am not sure we will. All we have managed to do \nis make more popular a policy that wasn't very popular when we started \ntrying to get rid of it. I voted for the motion to proceed to allow \ndebate to continue and amendments to be offered.\n  I will not vote for this bill as it is today. It is a shell of a bill \nright now. We all know that. I have changes urged by my State's \nGovernor that will have to be included to earn my support for final \npassage of any bill. I know many of you will have to see the bill \nchanged substantially for you to support it. We have tried to do this \nby coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with \nthe administration, then springing it on skeptical Members, trying to \nconvince them it is better than nothing--that it is better than \nnothing--asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified \nopposition. I don't think that is going to work in the end and probably \nshouldn't.\n  The administration and congressional Democrats shouldn't have forced \nthrough Congress, without any opposition support, a social and economic \nchange as massive as ObamaCare, and we shouldn't do the same with ours. \nWhy don't we try the old way of legislating in the Senate--the way our \nrules and customs encourage us to act. If this process ends in failure, \nwhich seems likely, then let's return to regular order. Let the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, under Chairman Alexander and \nRanking Member Murray, hold hearings, try to report a bill out of \ncommittee with contributions from both sides--something that my dear \nfriends on the other side of the aisle didn't allow to happen 9 years \nago. Let's see if we can pass something that will be imperfect, full of \ncompromises, and not very pleasing to implacable partisans on either \nside but that might provide workable solutions to problems Americans \nare struggling with today.\n  What have we to lose by trying to work together to find those \nsolutions? We are not getting much done apart. I don't think any of us \nfeels very proud of our incapacity. Merely preventing your political \nopponents from doing what they want isn't the most inspiring work. \nThere is greater satisfaction in respecting our differences but not \nletting them prevent agreements that don't require abandonment of core \nprinciples; agreements made in good faith, that help improve lives and \nprotect the American people. The Senate is capable of that. We know \nthat. We have seen it before. I have seen it happen many times. And the \ntimes when I was involved, even in a modest way with working on a \nbipartisan response to a national problem or threat, are the proudest \nmoments of my career and by far the most satisfying.\n  This place is important. The work we do is important. Our strange \nrules and seemingly eccentric practices that slow our proceedings and \ninsist on our cooperation are important. Our Founders envisioned the \nSenate as the more deliberative, careful body that operates at a \ngreater distance than the other body from the public passions of the \nhour. We are an important check on the powers of the Executive. Our \nconsent is necessary for the President to appoint jurists and powerful \ngovernment officials and, in many respects, to conduct foreign policy. \nWhether or not we are of the same party, we are not the President's \nsubordinates, we are his equal.\n  As his responsibilities are onerous, many, and powerful, so are ours. \nWe play a vital role in shaping and directing the judiciary, the \nmilitary, and the Cabinet; in planning and supporting foreign and \ndomestic policies. Our success in meeting all these awesome \nconstitutional obligations depends upon cooperation among ourselves.\n  The success of the Senate is important to the continued success of \nAmerica. This country--this big, boisterous, brawling, intemperate, \nrestless, striving, daring, beautiful, bountiful, brave, good, and \nmagnificent country--needs us to help it thrive. That responsibility is \nmore important than any of our personal interests or political \naffiliations. We are the servants of a great nation, ``a . . . nation, \nconceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are \ncreated equal.'' More people have lived free and prosperous lives here \nthan in any other Nation. We have acquired unprecedented wealth and \npower because of our governing principles, and because our government \ndefended those principles.\n  America has made a greater contribution than any other nation to an \ninternational order that has liberated more people from tyranny and \npoverty than ever before in history. We have been the greatest example, \nthe greatest supporter, and the greatest defender of that order. We \naren't afraid. We don't covet other people's land and wealth. We don't \nhide behind walls. We breach them. We are a blessing to humanity.\n  What greater cause could we hope to serve than helping keep America \nthe strong, aspiring, inspirational beacon of liberty and defender of \ndignity of all human beings and their right to freedom and equal \njustice? That is the cause that binds us and is so much more powerful \nand worthy than the small differences that divide us.\n  What a great honor and extraordinary opportunity it is to serve in \nthis body. It is a privilege to serve with all of you. I mean it. Many \nof you have reached out in the last few days with your concern and your \nprayers. It means a lot to me. It really does. I have had so many \npeople say such nice things about me recently that I think some of you \nmust have me confused with someone else. I appreciate it, though, every \nword, even if much of it isn't deserved.\n  I will be here for a few days--I hope managing the floor debate on \nthe Defense authorization bill, which I am proud to say is again a \nproduct of bipartisan cooperation and trust among the members of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. After that, I am going home for a \nwhile to treat my illness. I have every intention of returning here and \ngiving many of you cause to regret all the nice things you said about \nme, and I hope to impress on you again that it is an honor to serve the \nAmerican people in your company.\n  Thank you, fellow Senators.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)"], "Mr. GAETZ": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. GAETZ.

A member of FC Barcelona's famed youth academy system, \nLa Masia, Jonathan made his eventual debut with the senior team as a \n19-year-old during a match in Spain's Copa del Rey. He remained in \nBarcelona through 2014, making 29 appearances in all competitions, \nincluding matches played in the UEFA Champions' League, La Liga Super \nCopa, and the Copa del Rey.\n  In 2014, Jonathan transferred to Villarreal CF in La Liga, where he \ndeveloped into one of Spain's standout midfielders. During his time \nwith the club, he has made over 120 appearances in all competitions, \nwhile scoring seven times and adding eight assists. Internationally, he \nhas made 29 appearances in all competitions as a member of the Mexican \nNational Team, including matches in FIFA World Cup Qualifying and the \nFIFA Confederations Cup.\n  Jonathan's extraordinary soccer career, and his hard work to reach \nhis goals, are an inspiration to young people around the world. As a \nnew member of the Los Angeles Galaxy, he has become an incredible role \nmodel throughout Southern California.\n  Jonathan joined the Galaxy as the team's third Designated Player on \nJuly 28, 2017, and plays alongside his brother, Giovani dos Santos \nRamirez. Since joining the Galaxy, Jonathan's passion for giving back \nhas inspired his many philanthropic efforts in the LA community.

I ask Speaker Ryan and I call upon this \nChamber to vote now on the bipartisan, bicameral Dream Act.\n  This bill would provide permanent legislative protections for our \nDreamers, immigrants who were brought to the United States' shores as \nchildren at the average age of 6 years. For them, America is the only \ncountry they have ever known.

He is set to graduate from Fresno \nState with a degree in chemistry this year.\n  DACA gave him the ability to work through school and help his family. \nAnd after all, isn't that the immigrant way?\n  Just last week, Rodolfo got some great news. He learned that he was \nadmitted to the University of California, San Francisco's School of \nPharmacy, one of the best schools in the Nation.

In fact, there are only 76 of them \nthat are left. These whales depend upon healthy and abundant salmon \npopulations for survival. More than 50 percent of their diet comes from \nChinook salmon in the Columbia River basin. Without access to these \nwild salmon populations, Southern Resident killer whales are literally \nstarving to death.\n  In order to save both of these iconic species, we cannot undermine \nimportant habitat restoration efforts or improvements in dam \noperations, both of which are essential to promoting survival in the \nriver systems where these salmon spawn.

It saw the passage of the Fair \nHousing Act but the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and \nRobert F. Kennedy. 1968 saw President Johnson announce that he would \nnot run for a second term and Richard Nixon elected to succeed him.\n  In the midst of that tumultuous year, the National Advisory \nCommission on Civil Disorders, known as the Kerner Commission, issued \nits report examining the cause of riots and unrest that had occurred in \ninner cities and communities of color around the country.\n  After visiting those cities, interviewing witnesses, and consulting \nwith experts, the Kerner Commission submitted its findings to President \nJohnson. That groundbreaking report remains important five decades \nlater, not only as an historical document, but also because it \ndescribes the same issues of race that we struggle with today and how \nwe can overcome them.\n  The Kerner Commission's report identified twelve grievances that were \nshared in the communities of color where the unrest had taken place. \nAmong these were lack of economic opportunity, discrimination in the \nadministration of justice, and inadequacy of education, housing, and \nsocial welfare programs.\n  These same problems persist today.\n  Employment: In 2018, the unemployment rate for African-Americans is \n7.7 percent, compared to just 4.1 percent overall, and black workers \nmade 83 cents on the dollar compared to white workers.\n  Housing: only 41 percent of black households own their home, \nvirtually the same as 1968, while over 70 percent of white families own \ntheir homes.\n  Education: schools are more segregated now than they were thirty \nyears ago, and blacks are half as likely as whites to have a college \ndegree.\n  Justice: blacks are incarcerated at a rate of 3.5 times higher than \nwhites.\n  So we now find ourselves in the same situation as the one described \nin the Kerner report 50 years ago: ``Our nation is moving toward two \nsocieties, one black, one white--separate and unequal.''\n  Fortunately, the Kerner report also described a path to reverse the \ntrend of racial division. It called for ``the realization of common \nopportunities for all within a single society'' that requires ``a \ncommitment to national action--compassionate, massive and sustained, \nbacked by the resources of the most powerful and the richest nation on \nthis earth.

Mr. Speaker, Frederic Bastiat, the great 19th century \neconomist, posed a simple question that we need to think about \ncarefully as we consider tariffs and trade wars.\n  What is better: abundance or scarcity?\n  The answer might seem self-evident, but protectionists down through \nhistory just don't seem to grasp it.\n  Suppose widgets cost $1 in Canada, but $2 in America. That means you \ncan buy twice as many Canadian widgets by importing them. That is \ncalled abundance.\n  But some say that is not fair. We need to slap a $1 tariff on \nCanadian widgets to level the playing field. That means we can only \nafford to buy half as many. There is no more perfect way to turn \nabundance into scarcity than by levying a tariff on imports.\n  Yet that is what was precisely proposed for steel and aluminum. By \nslapping a tariff on foreign steel imports, the amount of steel \nAmericans can afford will diminish as the price rises, so, too, the \nprice of everything we make from steel, from cans to cars.\n  We are told this is necessary to save American steel jobs. Well, \nBastiat would tell us that what we cannot see is just as important as \nwhat we can. We see the American steel jobs the tariff has saved by \nblocking foreign competitors. What we don't see as clearly are the jobs \nthat disappear in every American industry that uses steel as their \nprices rise and demand for their products falls.\n  Remember, every producer in a society is also a consumer. No consumer \nbenefits from higher prices, and no producer benefits from scarcer \nmaterials.\n  Every country that has cried protectionism has suffered terribly, \nincluding ours. Thomas Jefferson thought high tariffs could fund the \ngovernment and promote domestic manufacturing. That caused a \ndevastating recession that nearly destroyed our fledgling economy. \nHerbert Hoover responded to the recession of 1929 with the Smoot-Hawley \nTariff Act. It didn't end well.\n  Trade is simply the exchange of goods, and both parties have to \nbenefit from the trade or it just doesn't happen. If I pay you $1 for a \ncup of coffee, I am telling you that your coffee is worth more to me \nthan my dollar, and you are telling me that my dollar is worth more to \nyou than your cup of coffee. When we make that exchange, we both take \naway something of greater value than we had.\n  But what happens if we slap a $1 tariff on that cup of coffee. Only \ntwo possible things: I am either going to buy less coffee, or I am \ngoing to buy less of other things to afford the tariff. Neither is good \nfor the economy.\n  True, some governments subsidize their exports, and that puts our \nproducers at a great disadvantage. In effect, these governments are \npicking up part of the tab for the stuff that we buy. As Milton \nFriedman observed, that is simply foreign aid to American factories and \nconsumers, paid for by the unfortunate taxpayers in the exporting \ncountries. The appropriate response for us is to say, ``thank you.''\n  Yes, that hurts the 140,000 American jobs that produce steel. But the \nother 6.5 million Americans who manufacture products using steel can \nmake more of their products, causing their producers to hire more \nworkers and to pay them more. Jobs will disappear in the steel mills, \nbut they will reappear as better jobs in industries that can now obtain \nmore steel at lower prices.\n  What would happen if we had a war?\n  Bastiat answered that question 150 years ago. He said trade, by its \nvery nature ``is a reciprocal dependence. We cannot depend on the \nforeigner unless the foreigner depends on us.'' If war clouds should \ngather between Canada--our biggest foreign supplier of steel--and the \nUnited States, we might face the prospect of losing their steel, but \nCanada would lose all of the American resources and products that their \nsteel exports buy. Trade reduces the risk of war because it increases \nthe value of peace.\n  Bastiat marveled at how much we spend to build ports and harbors, \nrailroads and highways, all for the sole purpose of surmounting the \nobstacles to trade that nature has created. What\n\n\nsense does it make to erect artificial barriers to replace the natural \nones that we have overcome?\n  By that same token, President Trump has set the stage for rapid \neconomic expansion by reducing the tax and regulatory burdens that were \ncrushing our economy, and the economy is responding. What sense does it \nmake to ruin that progress by replacing the taxes and regulations we \nhave shed, with new ones?\n"], "Mr. SERRANO": ["2017-12-21", "  Mr. SERRANO.

For instance, \nit does nothing to address the looming Medicaid cliff, which will \ndevastate health kits access and delivery on the island early next \nyear. It does not waive numerous local cost share requirements, which \nwill make it extremely difficult for the government of Puerto Rico to \naccess large parts of the Federal funding made available here.\n  It does not do enough to help States like New York and New Jersey and \nothers that have generously opened their arms to our fellow citizens \ndisplaced by these storms.\n\n\n  It expands the powers of the Puerto Rico Fiscal Oversight Board, \ngiving them authority to approve the recovery plans of Puerto Rico's \ngovernment.\n  The end result of all of this is further delay in Puerto Rico's \nrecovery. This is not the message that we want to send to 3.4 million \nAmerican citizens this holiday season.\n  As I look at my notes and as I look at what this debate may become \ntoday, it really comes down to one point: we as Americans, we as the \nUnited States Congress, we as the U.S. Government still have not come \nto grips with the fact that, yes, we have territories, that, yes, we \nhave colonies.\n  If you ask the American people, ``Are the people of Puerto Rico \nAmerican citizens?'' you would be shocked before all this information \nwent out on the hurricanes how many would say: ``I don't know. I served \nwith some in the Army, but I don't know if they are citizens.''\n  Well, I think, more and more, we need to know that the Virgin \nIslands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianna Islands, and \nPuerto Rico are part of the American family. It is not as a long gone \nmember of my party once told me when I said: What are we going to do \nabout Puerto Rico in this bill?\n  He said: Well, we have no money left over.\n  I said: Did you have money left over for the 50 States?\n  He said: Well, they go first.\n  I said: Why do they go first? Why can't the whole family go together?\n  So my plea that I have made for years, I continue to make.

I really thank him for his leadership on this issue.\n  The last time I spoke on this floor on immigration, I talked about \nthree principles: One, Americans have the right to determine who \nbecomes citizens through laws; two, the people who do come here should \nbe in the best interest of American citizens; and three, that we have \nthe right to enforce those choices.\n  The people who do come here should be in the best interest of \nAmerican citizens. That is key. What we are doing now isn't there yet. \nWe allow, today, one individual to get a green card. Then he is able to \nsponsor his immediate family and relatives. And then the relatives can \nsponsor their relatives. Then the relatives of those relatives can \nsponsor their relatives and so on, until there is no one in the family \nleft to sponsor or no one left who\n\n\neven wants to come to the United States.\n  Potentially, this could go on forever. This is called chain \nmigration, and 65 percent of our green cards are awarded through this \nchain migration. That is about 700,000 people every year gaining \npermanent residence in our country through no other criteria than that \nthey happen to be related to someone who lives here.\n  We have no idea whether these individuals are going to be \neconomically successful. We have no idea whether they will contribute \nto our country. We don't even look at those characteristics for chain \nmigration. The important question is who the immigrant is related to, \nnot whether or not he might help America be a safer or a more \nprosperous country. Chain migration does not meet that key principle. \nAmerican immigration should be in the best interest of Americans.\n  The Securing America's Future Act ends this chain migration. It stops \nit for everyone except the children and spouses of immigrants. But \nthose relatives cannot bring in additional immigrants, so the chain is \nbroken. The Securing America's Future Act, in turn, replaces those \nimmigrants with skilled workers, workers who could help us build a \nbetter future.\n  I think about it this way: there are 150 million people around the \nworld who would say that they would emigrate to the United States if \nthey were just given the opportunity. What a great country. We could do \nwhat we do now and let those people enter on the basis of who they are \nrelated to. That is what we are doing. Or we could let in the best \nengineers, doctors, nurses, teachers, and businessmen. We can let in \nthose who could speak English well, who know our system of government, \nwho have gone to university. But that can only happen if we end chain \nmigration.\n  The chain migration proposal in the Securing America's Future Act \nbecomes even more crucial when we look at the DACA issue. If we allow \nDACA recipients to get some form of residency, past history tells us \nthat they will potentially sponsor around 3\\1/2\\ immigrants each. That \nis a 2- to 3-million-person increase in the immigrant population. That \nis a huge incentive for future immigrants to come here illegally.\n\n\n  The notion that you will get to bring your whole family over here if \nyou manage to enter illegally is part of what led to the 2013-2014 \nborder crisis. When the previous administration was rumored to be \ngranting amnesty, tens of thousands of Latin American families sent \ntheir minor children north.\n  It was a national emergency, and it overwhelmed the Border Patrol and \nthe immigrant processing facilities there in the Southwest. We had to \npass emergency appropriations just to process these individuals. Any \nDACA fix that does not also include additional border security and \nprotections against those migrating this way, they could really see a \nsimilar crisis.\n  Madam Speaker, the Securing America's Future Act is an incredible \npiece of legislation. And while I have dwelt on its chain migration \nprovisions--and there are many more worthy reforms--this bill cracks \ndown on sanctuary cities, which my colleague mentioned earlier. It \nincludes Kate's Law to toughen penalties against those who are \ndeported, come back to the United States, and commit crimes. It \nincludes mandatory E-Verify to crack down on businesses that break the \nlaw. It ends the diversity visa lottery, one of the most senseless \nFederal policies that I can think of.\n  I thank Chairman Goodlatte for his efforts on this; I thank \nRepresentative Labrador, one of our staunchest conservative leaders in \nthe House, for his leadership in crafting this bill; and I thank \nRepresentative Garrett for organizing this opportunity to discuss the \nbill."], "Mr. KINZINGER": ["2018-02-26", "  Mr. KINZINGER.

It is hard to imagine that this modern-day slavery is \nhappening over here, hurting the people within our community every day. \nIn my home State of Illinois, we have the fifth highest number of \ntrafficking cases in this country; and the city of Rockford, in my \ndistrict, is ranked second behind Chicago in human trafficking cases.\n  The most important thing we can do to combat this heinous crime is to \nraise awareness. That is what the SOAR to Health and Wellness Act is \ndesigned to do. This important legislation would expand on a pilot \nprogram with the Department of Health and Human Services by supporting \nthe training of healthcare workers to identify victims and best care \nfor them through established protocols and procedures.\n  Many times, when trafficking victims come to emergency rooms, \nhealthcare professionals may not always spot the signs that their \npatient was a victim of human trafficking. Education is critical in \ncombating human trafficking, and our awareness could, in fact, save a \nlife.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 767. \nI believe it can have an impact towards identifying cases of human \ntrafficking and helping the most vulnerable and at-risk individuals of \nthis evil crime."], "Mr. LAWSON of Florida": ["2018-05-08", "  Mr. LAWSON of Florida.

Mr. Speaker, tonight, I wanted to do, actually, two \nor three things. Some of this has been bouncing in my head since we \nwere on this floor a few weeks ago doing the tax reform discussion \ndebate, and the number of things that were said that just sort of drive \nyou a little crazy because the math was wrong, or there was sort of \nmake-believe.\n  For those who have been, shall we say, sleep deprived enough to stay \nup and watch some of my presentations, which I do every couple of \nweeks, you know I have a theme that Congress is often a math-free zone. \nSo I thought this evening we would actually do a little math history \nand also talk about some really great things that are happening.\n  This is important. Think about the economy right now and what was \nhappening in the anticipation of tax reform and now that tax reform is \npassed. During the tax reform debate, we would hear arguments, often \ncoming from our brothers and sisters on the left, talking about income \ninequality.\n  So a couple of weeks ago, we did a presentation here on the floor \ndemonstrating that if you live in the world of the last decade, where \nyou are only growing about 1.8 percent GDP, and that joint tax and \nCBO--the people who are our scorekeepers--are saying, ``Hey, for the \nnext 30 years, you are only growing about 1.8 percent GDP growth,'' \nthat crushes people.\n  If you care about income inequality in our society, the way you solve \nit is growth. And there are lots and lots of data from leftwing groups, \nrightwing groups, and academic groups that say that growth is the \ngreatest cure to a society that has actually started to move apart \nwhere the haves have more and the have-nots have less. It turns out \nthat occurs when you have a stagnant growth society. It is obvious. \nThink about the last 10 years. Think about the projections of going the \nnext decade at 1.8 percent GDP growth.\n  One of the things I wanted to talk about is: if I came to you right \nnow and said, ``Let's just drop our partisan hats; you are not right; \nyou are not left;'' are you joyful that we are seeing data right now, \ntoday, where folks with felony convictions are finding jobs at a rate \nthat has not been seen in decades?\n  How would you feel when you see other populations that have actually \nhad a really rough decade finding jobs?\n  Isn't that what we all come here and stand behind these microphones \nand talk about?\n  Well, guess what, it is happening. If you look at some of the \nunemployment data, populations that have actually gone the last decade \nin a really rough position are finding employment, and there are some \namazing indicators.\n  Early last year, we came here and did a series of presentations on \nwhat was happening to the Social Security Disability Insurance Trust \nFund. It was collapsing.\n  About a month ago, we had a meeting with the Social Security \ndisability actuaries. Guess what. All of a sudden we went from the \ntrust fund is gone in about 2 years to, hey, they just added an \nadditional 4 years on it.\n  It turns out that parts of our society, which would have been heading \ntowards disability payments and, therefore, leaving the labor force, \nwere finding employment that actually worked with their difficulties.\n  This is great. These are good things. I know in this town of \nWashington it is just a partisan knife fight all of the time. I \nunderstand many of our brothers and sisters on the left believe rage is \na way to politically communicate.\n  I would actually like the math. And what we are seeing happen in our \ncommunities and our society for the populations we both care about, \ngood things are happening.\n  So how do we build policy around here that keeps it going?\n  The chart I have right here is sort of talking about what the \nprojections were as of October 2017--so fairly recent data--of what was \ngoing to happen over the next couple of decades in the amount of our \nsociety that would be in the workforce, and you see these lines just \ncrashing and crashing.\n  And all of a sudden--do you see the little dotted line--that is what \nwe were projecting in 2016.\n  Then, all of a sudden--do you see the solid line--it is up \nsubstantially. And that was the 2017.\n  What was happening between those 2 years--2016 to 2017--that, all of \na sudden, we start to see a substantial hopeful increase in people \nsaying there are going to be opportunities in the labor force?\n  It was a combination of what this body has been doing in 2017, \nwhether it be a rational regulatory model heading towards the optimism \nof tax reform.\n\n\n  If you love and care about people, providing opportunities to have \nyour income grow, the ability to save for yourself, your family, your \nkids' education, good things are happening. How do we keep it going?\n  So I want to walk through a couple examples out there if you follow \nthe press in our communities. I came across this story just last week \nin one of our counties in the southern part of Arizona, beautiful area. \nAll of a sudden, there is such a labor demand that our local \ncorrectional facility is actually now having demand to do skills \ntraining and, actually, employment for\n\n\nfolks that, if it were just a year or two ago, were often being \ndiscarded.\n  Look for these stories, find joy in them, because this is what we \ncare about: someone having an opportunity, saying they may have had a \nbad act in their life, but now that they are going to find employment, \nmaybe they have a future.\n  This is true, also, for many of our urban populations, for our low-\nskill populations, for populations that may not have graduated high \nschool. We have story after story after story of employers now having \nthe resources that they are actually providing the training for skill \nsets for employment.\n  Isn't this what so many of us have gotten behind these microphones \nover and over and over and talked about, saying there is a way for \neveryone to participate in this growing economy and have a joyous, \nhopeful future and economic stability?\n  So I want to actually take this a bit further. Some of this is \nadditional discussion on the debate that happened here last month and \ntalking about revenues. Let's see if this makes sense.\n  My grandfather used to have a saying. He said: It doesn't matter how \nyou play the game; it is who keeps score.\n  I know; it is an adjustment on an old colloquialism.\n  It turns out around here, we were having these discussions about \nprevious tax reforms, previous tax cuts, and we would hear things, and \nyou would go back and look it up, and the numbers were just made up. \nThey were not what was actually done. So we are going to actually \ncorrect some of that record today.\n  But the other thing we are going to finish on, the final two boards \nhere, we are going to actually sort of set the benchmark, the goal line \nof what the tax reform is expected to produce, what the tax reform \nshould be judged by so we never experience what we had last month where \npeople just make math up for their own argument, but we will actually \nknow, saying: This is the goal line. Judge us by what we call the \nbaseline.\n  So the slide right next to me right now was sort of talking about \nwhat we expected revenues to be. This is the history going back to \n1967. You will actually see in here, from 1967 to 2016, the mean was \n17.4 percent of the GDP came in as Federal revenues, and we had \nactually expected it to move up to about 18.4 percent.\n  I am sorry for this, but it gives you an idea.\n  And you are going to see this on the next couple boards. In times \nwhen we have raised taxes, when we have lowered taxes, when we have \ndone all sorts of things, that line of the amount of the economy that \ncomes in in Federal taxes actually stays within a very, very tight \nband, which lets you know maybe the fixation isn't on the tax rate but \nthe fixation needs to be on a tax policy that maximizes economic \nexpansion; because, if you are going to be always in there about that \n17.4 to 18 percent of GDP, have a bigger GDP, have a bigger economy if \nyou believe we need the additional revenues, which we do.\n  So on this, I want you to sort of take a look, because, overall, you \ncan look at times where we have had recessions and you see the revenues \ngo down; but you will see these dotted lines here, and these are some \nof the different, we will call them, tax cuts, tax relief. If you look \non every location, there is the 2003, and then look a year or so later, \nrevenues spike up.\n  In 2010, part of the Obama administration and this Congress, there \nwas a tax change that actually gave back more revenues to workers and \nthose who were creating employment, and revenues actually went up.\n  So it is on the chart. You cannot pretend that there hasn't been \nsocietal and economic expansions during these times.\n  So to actually drill this point down a bit more, in a lot of the \ndebate we had here last month, we had Member after Member from the left \ncome behind the microphones and say there is no such thing as a tax \nreform tax cut paying for itself. That is just absolutely not true. \nNow, there are lots of tax cuts over the history that didn't, but there \nare lots of them that have.\n  So let's actually walk through the actual data.\n  This is one of those occasions where, if you know what the baseline \nwas, saying this is what the projections were of revenues before the \nchange in policy, you can't keep moving the goal line after the policy \nis done to get your own argument to sound like it is competent.\n  So, in this case, we are going to actually look at when we did the \ncapital gains cuts back in, I think that was, 2003. A handful of \nMembers here on the other side came behind the microphones and talked \nabout how much money it lost. It turns out that is not true.\n  So, if you actually look at the blue, that is what CBO and Joint Tax \nactually calculated that the revenues were going to be before those tax \nchanges. Remember, the 2003 was functionally just a capital gains tax \nwith a couple other things. The red was actual revenues.\n  Now, this isn't the debt, this isn't spending, because, you \nunderstand, when you actually look at a deficit number, there are \nmultiple parts. There is the revenue and then there is the spending \naround here. And this body loves to conflate that argument, saying, \nwell, the debt went up to this. It is because we kept spending.\n  Look at the revenues in isolation and see what happened in that \ntrend. Well, if you look at this chart here, you actually see the red.\n  Now, this is capital gains taxes. There were lots of predictions that \nsaid capital gains taxes, you are cutting them, obviously we are going \nto take in a lot less revenue. It turns out it didn't work that way.\n\n  Let's walk through a couple more of these to just sort of demonstrate \nwhat that calculation is.\n  Also, as we discussed, the previous slide was actual hard revenues. \nThis one has its percentage of GDP, and you even notice even on a \ncalculation the size of the economy, there were more revenues coming in \nafter the capital gains tax cut of 2003. Many of you actually will \nrefer to it as the Bush tax cuts. I believe they expired in 2008.\n  Either way you try to judge it, whether it be on hard revenues or as \na percentage of GDP, guess what. It not only paid for itself, it made \nmoney; and yet we have Member after Member after Member who will come \nbehind these microphones and tell you it didn't.\n  So let's actually look at what the actual math was.\n  Prior to the 2003 to 2008 capital gains tax cut--sorry, I know \nsometimes these are big numbers and you are going sort of as fast as \nyou can--we expected about $13 billion in revenues from those capital \ngains. Excuse me. It is $13 trillion over that time.\n  If you take a look at that $13 trillion number, that is what the \nbaseline was before the 2003 capital gains tax cuts.\n  At the time it was modeled, CBO, Joint Tax came in and said: Guess \nwhat. You are going to go from the $13 trillion to only $12 trillion, \n$12.9 trillion.\n  Turns out, though, from 2003 to 2008, when you actually calculated \nthe actual revenues from those capital gains tax cuts, what happened? \nHow much money did we lose? Turns out we made $77 billion more than the \nprojection of revenues before the tax policy change.\n  This is really, really important to get our heads around.\n  So when someone comes behind these microphones and says, well, there \nis no such thing as a tax cut paying for itself, sure there is, because \nhere is the goalpost. The goalpost was set--or goal line was set before \nthe tax policy change. That is what the projection was over those \ncoming years. Then when the tax policy changed, it was projected to be \ndown here. You have got to look at the data from 2003 to 2008; and when \n2008 added up, it turns out the capital gains revenue was $77 billion \nhigher than the policy before those tax cuts.\n  So just understand, this place loves to tell stories, but they often \ndon't demonstrate the actual math.\n  So let's actually talk about what is going on right now. We heard \npredictions of everything from the end of the world to the end of the \nworld in regards to tax reform. As you know, there is functionally a \n$1.5 trillion placeholder for the tax cuts and reforms that we did in \nDecember that are now in effect.\n  So let's actually lay this out. This is actually what the projection \nwas going back to June. So this is fair and honest, saying this is what \nwe call the\n\n\nbaseline. The baseline is what we should be judged by. Every year, \nwhether I am here or another Member is here, I am hoping someone will \ncome up here and say: Okay, here is what we took in. Did we exceed what \nthe baseline was? Did we get less?\n  Well, over the next couple years, we will probably get less than that \nJune baseline. But what also happened to the projections, the curve, \nthe size of the economy? Remember, at the beginning of this discussion, \nwe talked about some really neat things happening in our society.\n  When we started to work on the actual drafting of the tax reform bill \nat the beginning of the year, we were living in a world that was only \ngoing to grow in the United States about 1.8 percent GDP growth, and \ntoday we are over 3. Now, some of that is anticipatory effects. Some of \nthat is a little excitement. There is a lot of confluence. But \nunderstand what that means in revenues and opportunities and just good \nthings for everyone in our society.\n  So we are going to go to the next board just because this one is \nreally hard to read.\n  So here is what I am asking everyone to do. If you be on the left, if \nyou be on the right, if you happen to be in the media, understand that \nthe June number was that, over the 2017 baseline, for functionally the \nnext 10 years, was $43 trillion of revenue. That is fair. Judge us on \nthat.\n  So 10 years from now, maybe someone will remember this and look back \nand say: Did we take in more revenues or less revenues in that time? \nBecause, if you consider what was said by the left, it was the end of \nthe world.\n  So that is the baseline number. We have on the previous chart sort of \nwhat was projected each year for the next 10 years.\n  So, if I am blessed to be here a year from now, I will come back \nJanuary 2019, stand behind this microphone, and we will look at the \nrevenues that came in in the 2018 fiscal year compared to what we \nprojected months before the tax reform became real. Judge us by that, \nbut don't come behind these microphones and make up Armageddon and then \nmake up stories about what has taken place in the past.\n  This is important, because if you care about people, if you care \nabout opportunity, we have some real difficulties coming towards us.\n  In lots of the data and lots of the charts, in about a decade and a \nhalf, 18 years or so, we hit a debt crisis, and your options are really \nsimple. You have to do substantial reductions to the dollars flowing \nout that are substantially in entitlements because, remember, three-\nquarters of this government's money rolls out in entitlements.\n\n\n  Only about 15 percent of our spending is actually defense, and \nanother 13 or so is everything else you think of government. Three-\nquarters of it is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid--all the things \nthat are just formula.\n  And where we are right now, the peak of the baby boom is 60 years old \ntoday. So economist after economist after economist, particularly those \non the left, have told us you can't grow more than 1.8 percent GDP. You \nare heading towards a debt crisis. You are heading towards this \nArmageddon.\n  So why wouldn't you stand up here, work to reform regulatory codes, \nthe Tax Code, the immigration codes, these things, and maximize the \nthings that will create growth and opportunity? I think that is just \nwhat, at least on the Republican side, we have been doing.\n  So the reason I put up this chart is more to lay a marker. I used the \nterm ``goal line'' before. Understand that is the number before the tax \nreform, and I believe a lot of it is anticipatory effects on the \neconomy. Hold us by that.\n  Now, who knows who will still be around here 10 years from now, but \nwill revenue exceed $43 trillion? That is the benchmark. You can't say: \nWell, the debt went to this, our spending went to this, because they \noperate outside the revenues. That is policy decisions made here on \nwhat to spend, our disasters--God forbid--military action.\n  But the revenue number is what we should be judged by. And when you \nsee what is happening right now in our communities, in our society, the \nnumber of organizations that have started to pay their employees more, \nthe number of organizations that are bringing back billions of dollars \nto invest here in our country, the research, the development, maybe a \nlot of the Malthusian economists out there--and for those of you who \ndon't get that, go look it up--who basically said the next three \ndecades of our life are basically constrained, dear God, I hope they \nare wrong.\n  We as a body need to continue this optimistic opportunity of coming \nand saying: Okay. How do we get more of our brothers and sisters to \nactually be in the labor force?\n  We know today we have about 6 million jobs that are going \nunfulfilled, lack of skills. We also know from recent publications, \nbecause of the tax reform, businesses are taking some of those \nresources and putting them into job training and taking populations \nthat were often being left on the sidelines and they are being drawn \nin. This is wonderful.\n  How do you actually turn to others and say: Should turning 65 or 67 \nbe hitting a wall? How do we actually provide you the opportunity, if \nyou so wish and so desire, to actually stay in the labor force and \ncontinue to help to grow this country? Because work, we know, is often \ngood for the soul and the individual, but it is also really good for \nour tax revenues and really good for the size of our economy.\n  Remember, the bigger the economy gets, the less that cliff, that \nwall, that debt crisis that is about a decade and a half away, the more \nthat gets pushed off into the future and the demographic curve that is \nthose of us who are baby boomers, maybe that doesn't create a debt \ncrisis. Maybe it actually turns into an opportunity for this economy, \nfor this society to continue to grow and be happy and healthy and \nprosperous.\n  This is one of those times I get behind the microphone and I am \nactually excited from what I am seeing out there in the data. I ask \nthis body, even with the partisan rancor, let's continue to adopt those \npolicies that grow, that bring people, provide opportunities to be part \nof the labor force, to be part of the American Dream; and by doing \nthat, the thing the left tells us they care about, income inequality, \nactually closes. The things so many of us care about of not hitting \nthat debt crisis maybe get postponed, maybe never happen.\n  There is a path here, but it has to be everything. It has to be the \ntax reform. We just accomplished that. It has to be rationalizing our \nregulatory system. We are working on that. It has to be an immigration \nsystem that focuses on maximizing economic expansion. It has to be the \nadoption of technology. We are working on it. I think we can get there.\n  This is just fun having a chance to get behind this microphone and \nactually be positive and optimistic after the last few years of where \nthings were quite dour.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n"], "Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York": ["2018-05-18", "  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York.

I celebrated this special occasion at \nSt. Andrew Dung-Lac and Companions Catholic Church in Lincoln, where I \nlive, and I participated in the Catholic mass, followed by a community \nfestival complete with traditional dragon dancers. I would like to \nthank Father Joseph Nguyen and the parish community for their \ngenerosity and hospitality.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are nearly 2 million persons of Vietnamese descent \nliving in America.

Vietnamese is the third most commonly spoken \nlanguage in the Cornhusker State, and I have actively encouraged the \nyouth to keep the great tradition alive.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is not advisable to try a language that you don't \nspeak, but to my Vietnamese friends, I would like to try: ``thank \nyou,'' ``cam o'n ban.''\n"], "Mr. McCARTHY": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I know \nyou reclaimed your time the time before, but let me finish what I was \nsaying.\n  With all due respect, what do we have to do? Yes, we have Fix NICS \nsitting over in the Senate. And, yes, we are going to add to it for \nschool violence. We know that it does not have to be partisan, but the \nbackground check system is broken. Let's not make it partisan. Let's \nget it done.\n  When it comes to the challenge for DACA, we are just down to four \nitems. Border security. Not one person in here would probably argue \nagainst that. And I know my friend across the aisle, Mr. Speaker, I \nknow his heart. He is a good man. He was, as he stated earlier, \nmajority leader. They had the majority here. They had 60 votes over in \nthe Senate. They had a lot of Members in the Senate, and they had the \nPresidency. Same problem at that time, too. They did not fix it.\n  I don't want to be in that same place in the future. My commitment is \nto fixing this problem. So let's sit down. Let's talk about border \nsecurity, but let's make sure our borders are actually secure.\n  When I look back--and people talk about that Gang of Eight bill--you \nput more money in there for border security than was even being \nrequested today. But people still, on the other side, say no, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  But the other point, too, is, if somebody comes from Mexico or Canada \nand illegally comes across the border, why are they sent back to their \ncountry but everybody else is not? Let's secure the border correctly. \nThen, when it comes to really protecting the nuclear family, why don't \nwe make it a little faster that you could have your children and your \nspouse with you? And do you know what that would do? I think that would \nmake everybody a little stronger.\n  When it comes to the idea of coming to America, should it just be the \nluck of a lottery, or should it be merit? I think merit is a fairer \nprocess for everybody's opportunity.\n  Now, I don't think anybody out there that is listening or can hear \nthis later would say those are partisan ideas. But when we sat in the \nWhite House and we discussed it and we said let's narrow it to those \nfour items, I know the way our government is designed.\n\n\n  It is not designed that one person gets all their way. It is based \nupon compromise.\n  This city, our capital, was because of a compromise. The creator of \nthe banking system, Alexander Hamilton, made this our capital. George \nWashington, our first President, never served here. He was sworn in on \nWall Street and served his second term in Philadelphia.\n  As my good friend knows, Mr. Speaker, when a bill comes out of \ncommittee, it gets worked on, then it is brought to the floor. That is \nexactly what is happening with Mr. Goodlatte today, so we can bring \nsomething to the floor and pass it, that everybody, hopefully, can vote \nfor.\n  This Congress has acted on so many items, but so many times this year \nit has felt like the election has never ended. I know the heart of many \nof the Members on the other side. They wanted to vote for disaster \nrelief. They were so frustrated that they shut the government down.\n\n\n  Do you know what? We have all learned from that lesson before. It is \nnot productive.\n  I also watched people when they talked about health facilities. They \nwanted that funding, but they couldn't vote for it.\n  Then they said the whole problem was, when we brought all 12 \nappropriation bills to the floor, that they couldn't vote for them \nbecause they needed a budget agreement. They needed more money. So, \nyes, it took a long time to work that out because you want to hold that \nwith other issues as well.\n  Finally, after the shutdown, that was able to be broken apart. But \nwhen we finally got that budget agreement that really is negotiated by \nboth sides, even the individual on the other side of the aisle, Mr. \nSpeaker, came to the floor and said she was going to vote ``no,'' but \nshe negotiated and wanted to tell how she got victories inside the \nbill.\n  That is not compromise. You can't sit in a room and say, ``Okay, I \nwill give here and you give there,'' and based upon the formation of \nour government, with the Senate as well, we come to an agreement.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't know what goes on in people's minds and why they \nwanted to be there. I will make this promise to the American public: I \nwill stay in the room, I will take the ups and downs, but at the end of \nthe day, I want to solve a problem. I don't want a political bill.\n  I will tell you this, Mr. Speaker. I have been in the room many times \nwith this President. He said on this very floor, he went beyond DACA. \nFor those in the American public must understand. It is a much higher \nnumber. And for him to find that compromise, he just asked for three \nother things. That doesn't mean we are going to get them all, but that \ndoes mean we could find compromise in those three.\n  Mr. Speaker, the one sad part, if we had this debate with the \nAmerican public, they would find compromise with those three items. \nThey would probably find it very fast. They would want their borders \nsecure; they would want the nuclear family closer together sooner; and \nthey would probably want to see some merit.\n  So I know there are times here that we get heated, but the majority \nof bills that pass this floor are bipartisan.\n  As I stated earlier, more than 200 of those more than 400 bills that \nare sitting in the Senate passed by voice, all the Democrats and all \nthe Republicans.\n  We are going to differ on some items, and that is right. I want you \nto keep your principles. But there is a window, and there is an \nopportunity.

Mr. Speaker, the leader spoke in a very calm and reasoned \nway. I will do the same.\n  As an aside, I will tell you the CHIP bill passed on November 3, over \na month after its authorization expired.\n  Mr. Speaker, the majority leader talks about coming to compromise. I \nwent down to the White House. Mr. Durbin and I talked about whether we \nwould go to the White House. We went to the White House out of respect \nfor the Presidency, out of a hope that the discussions that we had at \nthe White House would lead to resolution of a serious issue threatening \nhundreds of thousands, indeed, close to 2 million individuals who know \nAmerica as their country and who 86 percent of Americans think ought to \nstay here in America.\n  In that meeting, Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States \nsaid--and he said it on television. You don't have to take my word. \nThere is a video record of what the President said. What he said is we \nwould take care of the DACA issue, consistent, Mr. Speaker, with what \nSpeaker Ryan said to that young woman when he said that the revocation \nof protections for Dreamers brought here as children will not be \ncarried out.\n  There was no parenthetical addition, if we do X, Y, Z, A, B, C, D, W. \nThere was no parenthetical phrase. He said: We will not put you at \nrisk, young woman, and those similarly situated.\n  We have a bipartisan coalition on this floor, but the leader speaks \nabout going into a room--if you want to have a pejorative, a back room, \nprivately--to try to resolve issues not directly related to the DACA \nprotectees.\n  They are here. The President said they ought to stay here. And the \nPresident made a representation, Mr. Speaker, that if we passed a bill, \nhe would sign it. But as the Senate considered a compromise piece of \nlegislation, agreed to by Republican Senators and Democratic Senators, \njust a few hours before it was brought to the floor, the President said \nhe would veto it. That was not what he said on television in the White \nHouse. He said that he would take the heat, if heat there is, and sign \nthe bill that we sent down.\n  Now we have a Speaker of the House and a majority leader of the \nSenate who say we won't send something down to the President unless he \nagrees to sign it, meaning that the House and Senate will not act \nindependently of the President's imprimatur. How sad a position it is \nthat the people's House and the United States Senate have subjugated \nthemselves to the President of the United States.\n\n  I presume, Mr. Speaker, that prolonging this discussion apparently \nwill make no difference. But, Mr. Speaker, our side of the aisle \nrepresents just short of 50 percent, maybe 48 percent, of the American \npeople. Mr. Speaker, we are saying let us consider. Let us have on this \nfloor--not in a back room, not in somebody's office, not somewhere \nprivately--on the House floor, the people's floor, let us vote.\n  Let the American people see who raises their hand ``aye'' and ``nay'' \non propositions that have been worked on in committee, the Goodlatte \nbill, and for months between Republicans and Democrats, bipartisan \nbills. Let the people speak through their Representatives. Don't bottle \nit up in somebody's office. Let the people's House work its will. Have \nthe courage to pursue that which you said you would do and take the \ntough issues head-on, not duck them.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would hope, on behalf of that 86 percent of the \nAmerican people who support the Dreamers, and even more who support \ncomprehensive background checks, that we have the ability to consider \nthose bills and consider them next week.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n"], "Ms. FRANKEL of Florida": ["2018-01-18", "  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida.

Mr. Speaker, I wanted to bring the good news to Congress \nabout where we are on the gun violence debate because I know there have \nbeen a lot of accusations flying back and forth. I want us to look for \nthe common ground. I want to bring the good news today.\n\n\n  The good news is that we actually have an overwhelming policy \nconsensus in America as to what we need to do about gun violence, and \nwe have an overwhelming--indeed, a unanimous--judicial consensus about \nwhat is constitutional to do.\n  I want us to focus on that, and then that will allow us to isolate \nwhat the problem is in dislodging the paralysis in Washington today. \nBut let's start with the overwhelming policy consensus that has emerged \nin the wake of a sequence of massacres, and it is enough to invoke \ntheir names to remind people of the bloodshed that is engulfing our \nsociety in Parkland, Florida; in San Bernardino, California; in Las \nVegas; in Texas; at Virginia Tech; at Sandy Hook in Newtown, \nConnecticut; and so on. In the wake of all these massacres, America is \ndemanding action.\n  But here is the good news. Everybody has agreed. As close to a \nunanimous agreement as you are ever going to find in the United States \nof America has emerged: 97 percent of the American people favor a \nuniversal criminal and mental background check on all firearm purchases \nin America.\n  That is the overwhelming majority of Democrats, the overwhelming \nmajority of Republicans, the overwhelming majority of Independents, the \noverwhelming majority of gun owners, and the overwhelming majority of \nnon-gun owners. Almost everyone in America, 97 out of 100 people--and \nif you take the margin of error, it might be 99 out of 100 people--\nagree that firearms should not be sold without a background check so \nthat criminals, gang members, and terrorists can't go to a gun show and \nacquire a weapon of war and then use it in our schools, in our movie \ntheaters, in our churches, and in the public square.\n  So we have got virtually unanimous public consensus on that. Every \npublic opinion poll is showing the same thing, except the numbers \ncontinue to go up.\n  Now, some people will say in response to this: Aha, but the Second \nAmendment won't allow us to do anything.\n  There are a lot of people in this debate who are now wrapping \nthemselves in the flag of the Second Amendment and saying that the \nSecond Amendment prohibits us from implementing this overwhelming \npublic mandate for a universal criminal and mental background check; \nbut they are wrong, and we know that they are wrong.\n  The Supreme Court, in 2008, in the District of Columbia v. Heller \ncase, interpreted the Second Amendment definitively for us, at least \nsufficiently for us to understand that a background check is perfectly \nconstitutional.\n  In the Heller case, the Supreme Court first divided over the question \nof whether or not the Second Amendment confers a collective militia-\nbased right or an individual right. Four Justices said that the text of \nthe Second Amendment means that you only have a right to a firearm in \nconnection with militia service, which today we would call National \nGuard service.\n  You will recall the language of the Second Amendment is: ``A well \nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the \nright of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.''\n  Four Justices suggested that your right to bear and keep an arm is \ntethered to service in the militia. But that view lost. Five Justices \ntook the individual rights view that the so-called prefatory clause \njust announces the purpose of the Second Amendment, but it defines an \nindividual right.\n  But nine Justices, the entire Supreme Court, agreed that, whether the \nright was collective or individual in nature, that right is subject to \nreasonable regulation by Congress and by the States. Of course, that \nhas got to be right. Every right, all fundamental rights, are subject \nto reasonable regulation by the government.\n  Think about the First Amendment, which guarantees the right of free \nspeech. It gives you the right to go out and march in front of the \nWhite House, but does it give you the right to march in front of the \nWhite House at 2 o'clock in the morning with bullhorns and to wake up \nthe President's family? Of course not.\n  The First Amendment is conditioned on reasonable time, place, and \nmanner restrictions the Supreme Court held in a case called Ward v. \nRock Against Racism, where the Court said it was perfectly fine for New \nYork City to turn the sound down when they have a concert in \nCentral Park because there are other social activities taking place.\n\n  The Second Amendment is the exact same way, said the Supreme Court. \nYou have the right to possess a handgun for self-defense. You have a \nright to possess a rifle for purposes of hunting and recreation. You \ndon't have a right to a machine gun. There is no constitutional right \nto carry a sawed-off shotgun.\n  There is no constitutional right to carry weapons of war in public \nplaces. There is no right to carry a firearm in public buildings, said \nJustice Scalia, into public schools and into the U.S. Congress. There \nis no constitutional right for that, and there is certainly no \nconstitutional right for anybody to access a weapon without passing \nthrough the regulatory screen that the government sets up.\n  That is the common sense of the American people, too. Thomas Paine, \nwho wrote the pamphlet ``Common Sense,'' said that common sense is \nessential in a democracy because it is the sense that we have in \ncommon. The sense that we have in common today about guns that we need \na universal criminal and mental background check is something that is \nnearly unanimously held, and it is something that clearly passes \nconstitutional muster according to the Supreme Court's decision in the \nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller in 2008.\n  So we have got a public policy consensus, a popular consensus, and a \nconstitutional juridical consensus about the right thing to do and the \nconstitutional thing to do. Yet what do we have here in Congress? We \nhave got paralysis. We have got absolute inaction in defiance of the \npublic will.\n  Why? Nobody really says. The GOP leaders, Mr. Speaker, simply refuse \nto bring a universal background check bill to the floor of Congress. \nThey won't even permit a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee about \nit, despite the fact that that is what everybody wants and that is what \nthe times demand right now.\n  Why? Have we become a failed state?\n\n\n  Are we unable to govern?\n  Does democracy not work anymore?\n  Is that what we are saying?\n  I hope not. I hope we have not become a failed State. I hope we are \nable to address the public safety needs of the people. I hope we are \nable to address the democratic will of the American public. I hope we \nare able to effectuate the majority will of Congress, because we know \nthat, forced to a vote, a majority of Congress would support this.\n  So what is going on?\n  Well, James Madison, in Federalist Paper No. 10, predicted it well \nwhen he talked about the problem of faction. He talked about a minority \nof people animated by some passion or some common interest that goes \nagainst the rights of the rest of the public and against the common \ngood, against the general interest of the people.\n  But our institutions have got to be set up to legislate over the \ndemands of one small faction, the 2 or 3 percent of the people who \ndon't want to see a universal background check because they spread the \nmythology that any gun safety regulation will lead to a confiscation of \npeople's firearms, which is utterly absurd and ridiculous and \ndemonstrably false.\n  Yet, that tiny group of people, that tiny faction, has been allowed \nin this Congress to control the public agenda and to dictate to \neverybody else, when we have tens of thousands, and soon, on Saturday, \nMarch 24th, hundreds of thousands of young people marching for the most \nelementary rights of life in a civil society.\n  And what is that?\n  The right to security and safety--the whole reason we have got a \nsocial contract. If you read your Thomas Hobbes, you read your John \nLocke, you read your Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the whole basis of civil \nsociety is that we will be safer entering into the social contract than \nwe would be if we stuck it out in the state of nature, which John Locke \nand Thomas Hobbes described as a war of all against all, where life is \nnasty, poor, brutish, and short.\n  So we are asking for the leadership in Congress simply to act. Let us \nbring this bill to the floor of Congress, and\n\n\nstop with the distractions and the deflections and the diversions. They \ncan bring up 50 other things. The people of America know, with our \ncommon sense, that we need a universal criminal and mental background \ncheck for everyone.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would love it if someone could explain why that \nlegislation is not allowed to see the light of day on the floor of the \nHouse with not even a hearing or a vote in the House Judiciary \nCommittee. This is a public emergency. The young people of America, \nbeginning with the heroic kids, the survivors in Parkland, Florida, \nwill not let us off the hook.\n  One of them was asked the question: Well, why suddenly have you \nunleashed this revolution across the country against one minor faction \ncontrol of all of Congress? Why did it happen now, but it didn't happen \nback at Sandy Hook?\n  One of the young leaders said: ``At Sandy Hook, they assassinated \nfirst graders with an AR-15 at pointblank range; but in Parkland, \nFlorida, they assassinated high school students. We are more educated \nand we have a voice and we know how social media works.''\n  There is no putting the genie back in the bottle. There is going to \nbe no avoiding this question. At the very least, we must have a vote on \na universal criminal and mental background check for all firearm \npurchases in the United States of America. The people want it. The \nSupreme Court has made it clear that such legislation is \nconstitutional.\n  In Maryland, in 2013, we passed not only fingerprint licensing and \nuniversal background checks, we passed a ban on military-style assault \nweapons, a ban on high-capacity magazines. These are bans that are, \nagain, favored by more than two-thirds of the American people.\n  It was challenged in Federal district court in Maryland and it was \nupheld against Second Amendment attack. They appealed to the Fourth \nCircuit of Appeals. It was upheld against Second Amendment attack. They \nwent to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court let it stand.\n  So within the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, within our circuit, we \nhave already got all of the legislation upheld as constitutional, which \nsome people are saying you can't do because of the Second Amendment.\n  Stop hiding behind the Second Amendment. Stop hiding behind it. The \nSecond Amendment is just like every other amendment. You can pass a \nreasonable regulation, as long as you don't destroy the underlying \nright itself.\n  Nobody is trying to take away anyone's handgun for self-defense. No \none is trying to take away anyone's rifle for hunting and recreational \npurposes. But you don't need an AR-15 in order to go hunting. Any real \nhunter will tell you.\n  You certainly don't need to allow the sale of firearms in the United \nStates of America to criminals and terrorists and gang members in order \nto support the Second Amendment. That is ludicrous. It is absurd. We \nshould stop spreading that propaganda. I think it is just so important \nthat we get this message out to the American public."], "Mr. MARSHALL": ["2018-02-26", "  Mr. MARSHALL.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1119, the \n``Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act''.\n  The SENSE Act continues yesterday's latest effort by Republicans to \nundermine the commonsense protections found in the Clean Air Act in \norder to give special breaks to polluters at the expense of public \nhealth. The winner of today's Republican special breaks are power \nplants that burn waste coal.\n  The SENSE Act would give power plants that burn waste coal for energy \na free pass on critical public health protections that keep dangerous \ntoxins out of the air.\n  It does this by giving waste coal power plants a carve-out from the \npollution control requirements of EPA's Mercury and Air Toxic \nStandards--or MATS Rule. This rule represents the first national \nstandards to address power plant emissions of toxic air pollutants like \nmercury, arsenic, dioxin, sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid.\n  The SENSE Act provides a weaker compliance option for MATS that would \ngive waste coal facilities license to pollute more than they should. \nAnd, the bill would lock in this weaker standard for the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  That means a small number of waste coal units would be allowed to \navoid controlling harmful pollution in perpetuity, regardless of any \nsubsequent developments in control technologies, or new information on \nthe health effects of their pollution. Passing this bill means waste \ncoal power plants would never have to clean up their act, putting the \nhealth and safety of those nearby and downwind in jeopardy.\n  So, why are we even discussing such a ridiculous sweetheart deal? \nBecause the waste coal industry says they need, and deserve, a \nlegislative earmark, just for using the coal that wasn't good enough to \nburn in other power plants.\n  But that claim doesn't pass the smell test.\n  EPA determined, and the D.C. Circuit Court agreed, that since \nemissions from waste coal units are no different than emissions from \nother coal-fired power plants, there is no justification for special \ntreatment. Many of the waste coal plants already meet the requirements \nof the MATS rule, because in reality, waste coal plants are among the \nbest performing coal-fired power plants in the country.\n  I see no justification for giving waste coal plants the ability to \npollute more than other facilities, as the SENSE act would allow.\n  These special breaks are especially offensive to me since I represent \na down-wind state. Pollution generated west of New Jersey moves into \nour air shed threatening the public health and welfare of my \nconstituents. It also increases the burden on New Jersey businesses \nthat would ultimately be required to do\n\n\nmore and spend more to compensate for the extra pollution generated by \nthese plants.\n  The Republicans claim that EPA is over-regulating business. But, time \nand again, the courts have found that EPA is actually failing to \nregulate pollutants known to cause harm. This Mercury and Air Toxics \nrule has been in development and litigation for nearly 20 years--the \ntime it takes for a child to reach adulthood. That's more than enough \ndelay, enough mercury, and enough toxic air pollution. It's time to \nclean it up.\n  Republican-led attacks on clean air protections will not create jobs, \nnor will they magically build infrastructure. All a Yes vote on this \ndirty air bill will do is boost profits for Republican allies, and make \nit easier for corporate polluters to contaminate the air in our \nneighborhoods.

Mr. Speaker, ask anyone who lives in or near communities \nwith waste coal piles from abandoned mines and they will tell you that \nthey can be a significant environmental hazard. They can leak acidic \nwater into rivers and streams. They can sometimes catch fire, burn \nuncontrollably for months and result in both damage and heavy \nemissions. And they can be an economic drag on any community that has \nto deal with them.\n  The good news is that a process exists that can take this byproduct \nand use it to produce electricity. The result of that process is an \nenvironmentally-safe ash that can be used to remediate the land from \nwhich the waste coal was taken. It has worked well, and there are \nnumerous examples of contaminated lands and streams being restored \nbecause of these coal refuse-to-energy plants.\n  Given the substantial environmental benefits of coal refuse-to-energy \nplants, I believe we have an obligation to work to keep them open. That \nis why I urge support for H.R. 1119, the SENSE Act.\n  Unfortunately, these plants are at risk of being tripped up by EPA \nregulations aimed at conventional coal-fired power plants. \nSpecifically, EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics standards did not \ndistinguish between conventional coal-fired plants and these coal \nrefuse-to-energy plants that operate very differently. The EPA's \nstandard as written for one of the targeted compounds, hydrogen \nchloride, or HCL, would be difficult for these facilities to \nconsistently meet.\n  The bill before us today, H.R. 1119, the SENSE Act, addresses these \nconcerns and provides an alternative compliance mechanism for HCL that \nstill requires substantial emissions reductions, but one that is \nachievable for these facilities.\n  By finding a use for potentially dangerous and damaging coal refuse \npiles, coal refuse-to-energy plants provide affordable energy and a \ntremendous environmental benefit.

This day, founded by the World Health Organization, moves \nthe needle as it relates to hearing healthcare in the United States.\n  Hearing plays a critical role in one's quality of life and personal \nsafety. We rely on hearing to feel connected to the world around us. \nOver 37 million adults in America suffer from hearing loss, and we're . \nseeing a growing number of children as well. Hearing loss has been tied \nto depression, economic hardship, and underlying medical conditions. \nHearing aids are a proven method of rehabilitation for the majority of \nthose who have lost their ability to hear. Yet just 30 percent of those \nwho could be helped by hearing aids use them.\n  That's why I joined my colleague from California, Mr. Thompson, in \nintroducing H. Res. 740, which expresses support for the designation of \nMarch 3rd as World Hearing Day, and recognizes the importance of \nhearing loss prevention and hearing healthcare access.

The manufacturing of brick and clay tiles can emit \ntoxics such as mercury and arsenic, both of which cause severe harm to \nhuman health. There is no need for this legislation; the law already \nallows judges to postpone regulations from taking effect. Under the \nbill, companies that make brick and clay tiles could continually file \nlaw suits, regardless of the merits, in effect killing the regulation. \nFurther delaying the regulations means continuing to expose Americans \nto deadly toxic air pollution.\n"], "Mrs. DINGELL": ["2018-02-27", "  Mrs. DINGELL.

The \nPrinciples are meant to serve as an internal compass to help guide \ndecisions and shift behaviors of hockey organizations, as well as \nplayers, parents, coaches, fans, partners and all those who represent \nand care for the sport of hockey.\n  These Principles are:\n  1. Hockey should be an enjoyable family experience; all \nstakeholders--organizations, players, parents, siblings, coaches, \nreferees, volunteers and rink operators--play a role in this effort.\n  2. Hockey's greatest value is the role it plays in the development of \ncharacter and life skills.\n\n\n  3. All hockey organizations--regardless of size or level of \ncompetition--bring value to players and families in their ability to \ndeliver a positive family experience.\n  4. Physical activity is important for a healthy body, mind and \nspirit.\n  5. There are significant benefits of youth participation in multiple \nsports.\n  6. Hockey programs should be age-appropriate for all players, \naccounting for each individual's physical, emotional and cognitive \ndevelopment.\n  7. There is great value in all forms of hockey, both on and off the \nice.\n  8. All hockey programs should provide a safe, positive and inclusive \nenvironment for players and families regardless of race, color, \nreligion, national origin, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation \nand socio-economic status. Simply put, hockey is for everyone.\n  This set of principles serve as a powerful platform for participants \nto build character, foster positive values and develop important life \nskills that transcend the game.

Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill similar to one I \nhave introduced in five previous Congresses, the Universal \nPrekindergarten and Early Childhood Education Act of 2018. This bill is \nparticularly important today because recent reports indicate that \nAmericans are limiting the number of children they have due to the cost \nof child care. My bill begins the process of providing universal \nprekindergarten education in public and public charter schools in \nstates that have or plan to phase in or are phasing in prekindergarten \neducation for three-and four-year-old children. The District of \nColumbia has made considerable strides since I first introduced this \nbill, but today's bill is still needed to fill a hole in the ``Every \nStudent Succeeds Act,'' which addresses elementary and secondary \neducation, but ignores the prekindergarten years, the most critical \nyears for children's brain development. My bill also seeks a \nbreakthrough in public education by providing the initial funding for \nstates to encourage local school districts to add prekindergarten for \nchildren at three or four years of age, whereas kindergarten programs \nfor five year olds are now routinely available in public schools. This \nbill would eliminate some of the major shortcomings of unevenly \navailable ``day care'' and, importantly, would take advantage of the \nsafe facilities required in public schools. Unless early education \nbecomes a necessary part of a child's education, it almost surely will \ncontinue to be unavailable to the majority of families with children.\n  My bill provides federal funds to states, which must be matched by at \nleast 20 percent with the state's own funds, to establish or expand \nuniversal, voluntary prekindergarten in public and public charter \nschools for three-and four-year-olds, regardless of income. The \nclasses, which would be full-day and run throughout the entire school \nyear, must be taught by teachers who possess equivalent or similar \nqualifications to those teaching other grades in the school. The funds \nwould supplement, not supplant, other federal funds for early childhood \neducation. The unique money-saving aspect of my bill is that it uses \nthe existing public school infrastructure and trained teachers to make \nearly childhood education available to all, saving billions of dollars \nin its implementation.\n  The success of Head Start and other prekindergarten programs, \ncombined with new scientific evidence concerning the importance of \nbrain development in early childhood, virtually mandate the expansion \nof early childhood education to all children today. Early learning \nprograms have been available only to the affluent, who can afford them, \nand to low-income families in programs such as Head Start, which would \nbe unaffected by my bill. My bill provides a practical way to \nuniversal, public preschool education for the majority of families. The \ngoal of the bill is to afford the benefits of early childhood education \nto the majority of the American working poor, lower-middle-class and \nmiddle-class families, most of whom have been left out of this \nessential education for their children.\n  We cannot afford to continue to allow the most fertile years for \nchildhood development to pass, only to wonder why a child cannot read. \nThe bill responds both to the great needs of parents who seek early \nchildhood education, as well as to today's brain science, which shows \nthat a child's brain development begins much earlier than had been \npreviously understood.\n  Considering the staggering cost of day care, the inaccessibility of \nearly childhood education and the opportunity that early education \noffers to improve a child's chances of success, schooling for three-and \nfour-year-olds is overdue. The absence of viable options for working \nfamilies demands our immediate attention.\n  My bill reflects what jurisdictions throughout the nation \nincreasingly are trying to accomplish. The District of Columbia, for \nexample, has achieved an extensive integration of early childhood \neducation as part of a larger effort to improve D.C. public schools. A \nrecent report highlighted the economic benefits of early childhood \neducation, emphasizing its role in expanding job opportunities and \ndecreasing the amount of money spent on programs to address teen \npregnancy, crime and the like.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n"], "Mr. DeSAULNIER": ["2018-02-26", "  Mr. DeSAULNIER.

I am proud to be involved in \nthis wonderful program for the third year in a row.\n  Kate Hitchcock, a student from the University of Canberra, has \nquickly proved herself to be a highly valuable member of our team. She \nhas drafted legislative requests, attended briefings, written \nconstituent mail, and researched important issues, among many other \nduties. She consistently displays a deep desire to learn and treats \neveryone she encounters with respect. Her hard work and dedication is \nan asset to our office and the Eleventh Congressional District.\n  Kate has learned about the United States and the U.S. Congress, and \nour team has learned a great deal from Kate about her native country. \nShe is a pleasure to have in the office and I offer her my thanks for a \njob well done. I wish her the best of luck in all of her future \nendeavors.\n"], "Mr. CUMMINGS": ["2017-10-06", "  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chair, as the Ranking Member of the Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform, I strongly oppose House Concurrent \nResolution 71.\n  This Budget Resolution would direct the Oversight Committee to \nidentify a minimum of $32 billion in savings over ten years.\n  Only two of the other 11 authorizing committees would be instructed \nto make more drastic cuts to federal programs--the Ways and Means \nCommittee would have to identify at least $52 billion and the Judiciary \nCommittee would have to identify at least $45 billion in cuts.\n  Once again, House Republicans are targeting middle class civil \nservice workers and their pensions for massive reductions.\n  The Republican Budget would require federal workers to contribute \nsignificantly more to their pension plans than they do now.\n  It would also end the retirement supplement for employees like law \nenforcement officers who are required by law to retire before reaching \neligibility age for Social Security benefits.\n  It would also eliminate pensions altogether for new hires.\n  This Budget Resolution would slash the federal workforce by 10 \npercent through attrition in certain agencies by limiting agencies to \none new hire for every three employees who leave.\n  I am utterly dismayed at the relentless Republican attacks on middle \nclass federal workers without any real consideration of what they do \nevery single day for the American people.\n  Over the past several years, Republicans in Congress have cut federal \nemployee compensation and retirement benefits for a total of nearly \n$200 billion in order to pay for deficit reduction and other government \nprograms.\n  The argument that federal workers must sacrifice for the good of the \ncountry might have made some sense when the country was struggling \nduring the Great Recession, and they did sacrifice.\n  But it makes much less sense now that our economy is recovering and \nthe wage gains made by private sector workers are far outstripping \nthose of workers who commit their lives to public service.\n  The argument that federal workers must be continually forced to \nsacrifice for deficit reduction also loses its strength when House \nRepublicans are trying to give tax cuts to the wealthy without paying \nfor it.\n  The Republican tax package would add $2.4 trillion to the deficit \nover 10 years, and 80 percent of tax cuts would benefit the top 1 \npercent of Americans, who earn at least $900,000.\n  While the wealthiest in our country would receive the vast majority \nof tax cuts, one third of middle class families making between $50,000 \nand $150,000 would see their taxes increase.\n  Many of these middle class families are federal workers who dedicate \ntheir lives to serving the American people.\n  It is unfair and uncompassionate to treat our civil servants in this \nway.\n  These are the men and women who aided in the rescue and recovery \nefforts as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria tore through Texas, \nLouisiana, the Southeast, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.\n  More than 32,000 federal employees were involved in helping families \ntrapped in the storms.\n  They include: disaster response teams from the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who provided temporary \npower and roofing, debris removal, and infrastructure assessment; \nNational Guard soldiers and airmen who delivered food and water to \nsurvivors and cleared debris to open roads; Department of Energy \npersonnel who ensured that fuel was available in impacted areas; Public \nHealth Service officers who provided healthcare, including dialysis \nservices to those in need; Members of the U.S. Coast Guard who helped \nensure the delivery of relief supplies; and Agriculture Department \nemployees who provided food to schools, shelters, and disaster \norganizations.\n  Rather than targeting and penalizing these brave and selfless public \nservants, Congress must do a better job at showing how much we \nappreciate their efforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against House Concurrent Resolution 71.\n"], "The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Byrne)": ["2017-01-05", "  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Byrne).

I \nam honored to represent the Sixth Congressional District in the House \nof Representatives, home to kind-hearted and caring Virginians like the \nBerry family.\n  This March marks the 10th annual Brent Berry Food Drive. For a \ndecade, Brent has worked countless hours, often in below freezing \ntemperatures, collecting food for local families in his hometown of \nHarrisonburg. The food drive benefits the Salvation Army, collecting \nmost of the food the organization needs to feed over 300 families per \nmonth. In 2017, the Brent Berry Food Drive collected nearly 11,000 food \nitems.\n  Brent's strong desire to serve the community is remarkable, and he's \na familiar face around Harrisonburg. You'll find him outside of grocery \nstores, shopping centers, and on local university campuses. Brent has \nalso recruited the help of the local fire, police, and sheriff's \ndepartments to assist in collecting donations. I've participated in the \nfood drive several times myself, and I am often amazed by the support \nit receives from friends and neighbors.\n  And what's most touching is that Brent's partner in service is his \nfather, Bucky, who\n\n\nonce relied on the services from the Salvation Army himself. He recalls \nliving in a shack as a 5-year-old boy, his family not having enough to \neat. The same organization that his son now passionately volunteers for \nprovided young Bucky and his family with meals and even presents at \nChristmas.\n  Brent's passion for service and selfless nature are unmatched. So \nmuch so, that in February of this year, he was presented with a key to \nthe City of Harrisonburg by the City Council. This is a well-deserved \nhonor.\n  It is hard-working and dedicated volunteers like Brent Berry who make \nreal differences in our communities.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay \ntribute to Sanford and Joan Weill as we mark the 20th anniversary of \nthe renaming of Weill Cornell Medical School in their honor. The Weills \nare renowned for their extraordinary philanthropic contributions to \nculture, education and medical research.\n  Mr. and Ms. Weill are Brooklyn natives who grew up in modest \ncircumstances, and worked hard to make a better life for themselves and \ntheir family. Mr. Weill started out as a $30-a-week runner at Bear \nStearns, while Ms. Weill worked as a teacher to help them make ends \nmeet. Wanting more, in 1960, he and his partners founded their own \ninvestment firm. The firm was eventually sold to American Express and \nMr. Weill became President of American Express. He left American \nExpress and started acquiring financial services companies, until he \ncreated the financial giant now known as Citicorp.\n  Throughout their lives, Mr. and Ms. Weill have been incredibly \ngenerous supporters of many of the institutions and organizations that \nare central to New York. They founded the National Academy Foundation, \na foundation that partners with schools in underserved communities to \nconnect them with specialized training programs and internships in \nfinance, STEM, and hospitality & tourism. Inaugurated with one pilot \nfinance academy in the heart of Brooklyn, the foundation has now grown \nto 675 academies in over 36 states and serves approximately 100,000 \nchildren a year.\n  The Weills have played a key role in our cultural institutions. Mr. \nWeill served for many years on the board of Carnegie Hall, and helped \nshepherd it through a major renovation. Thanks to their generosity, one \nof the three performance halls is named the Joan and Sanford I. Weill \nRecital Hall. A devotee of modern dance, Ms. Weill served on the board \nof the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater for 20 years, 14 as Chair. At her \nretirement celebration, more than $40 million was raised in her honor, \ncapping off an eminent career and enabling the company to expand its \nbuilding.\n  More impressive still is the enormous impact Sanford and Joan Weill \nhave had on medical education. Mr. Weill was a longtime Trustee of \nCornell University and became Chairman of their medical school. In \n1998, the Weills gave $100 million to the medical school, prompting the \nschool leaders to rename the institution Weill Cornell Medical College. \nSince then, the couple has generously given over $600 million to the \nschool, helping to ensure its legacy as one of the premier medical \ninstitutions in the world.\n  In 2001, I had the pleasure of helping to midwife the creation of a \nmedical school in Qatar. I brought Qatar's interest in having a school \nthat offers an American medical degree to the attention of Mr. Weill \nand he helped make it happen. Thanks to his vision, Cornell University \nis the only institution to offer its MD degree outside the country. The \nWeills also made possible the Weill Bugando University College of \nHealth Sciences in Tanzania. I am proud that Cornell University \naccepted the challenge of creating an applied sciences school on \nRoosevelt Island and I was pleased to join the Weills to break ground \non Cornell Tech which opened its doors September 12, 2017.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Sanford and \nJoan Weill, the very embodiment of the American dream.\n"], "Ms. KELLY of Illinois": ["2018-02-26", "  Ms. KELLY of Illinois.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for \nbringing this important bill to the floor.\n  We have heard it mentioned that, in 2002, in a bipartisan way, we \nalready have law that a baby born alive, at any stage of gestation, any \nweeks of life, born alive, it is already illegal to kill the baby, and \nthat was a bipartisan bill; so I can understand why my friends on the \nother side of the aisle want to keep changing the subject. Every vote \ntoday should be for this bill.\n  We have already agreed that you have to save the lives of these \nchildren. The problem is that we don't have strong enforcement \nmechanisms. This bill provides enforcement mechanisms. This bill \nspecifies any medical care. This should be a unanimous vote.\n  That is what we need to talk about here today--in fact, life begins \nat conception--to have laws that protect babies born alive. Now, \nremember, these are babies who are born alive. There have been \nquestions about whether or not it happens.\n  Melissa Ohden, who testified in the Judiciary Committee a couple of \nyears ago, was a baby born alive. She started her own network, the \nAbortion Survivors Network, where she has had contact with 203 other \nabortion survivors.\n  Sometimes when they go in to start the abortion, they start the \ntreatments, the dilation, and the chemical treatments, the baby comes \nout alive. I know people listening to this here today might believe \nthat this is a horror story and that this doesn't happen. It happens in \nAmerica.\n  We need to fight this, make it illegal, and pass this bill, so that \nthose babies are given the same protection as any other child who is \nalive. This is a no-brainer. The only shame today is that when this \nvote is cast later, if there are not 435 ``yes'' votes on that board \ntoday, that should be the shame of this situation. These are live \nbabies. This is a no-brainer bill.\n  I am proud to represent the State of West Virginia, where respect for \nhuman life is cherished. Every Member of this body should respect human \nlife. If it is already law, you should have no problem voting for it. \nThat is all the more reason to support the bill before us today.\n  The voters of this country have elected us to do the job of the pro-\nlife majority. It is time we pass bills like this, and more bills like \nthis, so that we can show people we care about the unborn children.\n\n"], "Mr. EMMER": ["2018-01-18", "  Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, every citizen in our Nation desires the \nchance to achieve their American Dream. For thousands across this \ncountry, their American Dream consists of owning a home or starting \ntheir own business.\n  Some laws have proven helpful in achieving this dream; others have \ncreated obstacles by codifying government overreach.\n  In 1975, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act was enacted. This important \nlaw exposed and helped eliminate discriminatory lending practices, \nparticularly against minorities. In short, this law helped more \nAmericans realize their dream of owning a home.\n  Over the years, however, the disclosures required by the law have \nexpanded away from the original intent and have actually become an \nobstacle, preventing small, medium, and local lenders from helping \naspiring landowners and business entrepreneurs.\n  In 2015, the Dodd-Frank-created agency, the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, CFPB, demanded from lenders more than double the \namount of data originally required under the Home Mortgage Disclosure \nAct.\n  That double-the-data rule took effect on the 1st of this month. \nLarger lenders are able to adapt. In fact, most, if not all, continue \nto be in the home mortgage business today.\n  But for smaller lenders, for the family-owned bank on Main Street, \nthe double-the-data rule means making fewer mortgages or none at all. \nThis unintended result is something each of us has heard over and over \nagain in our home districts.\n  Again, these are not the Wells Fargos, the Bank of Americas, or the \nJ.P.Morgans. These are the small guys, the little guys on Main Street \nMinnesota and Main Streets all across this country.\n  We all remember the financial crisis of 2008 and the devastation it \nbrought to this Nation. Our economy suffered greatly.\n\n\n  No one wants that again. Unfortunately, Congress reacted by demanding \nthat small banks and credit unions, quite literally, pay for a crisis \nthey didn't cause. In the great State of Minnesota, the ``Land of \n10,000 Lakes,'' I consistently hear from small banks and credit unions \nthat want to do what they do best: help Minnesotans achieve the \nAmerican Dream.\n  Due to the increased cost of compliance with the CFPB's double-the-\ndata rule--an estimated additional $326 million--many small banks in \nMinnesota are reconsidering their ability to continue to make mortgages \nand other covered loans.\n  In 2014, Minnesota credit unions were on the hook for $7.2 billion in \ncompliance costs. That is before the double-the-data rule. Not only are \nthe additional HMDA compliance burdens ill-suited and unnecessary for \nthese institutions, the CFPB's rule does very little to provide \nadditional protection, all while potentially exposing consumers to \npotential identity theft or fraud.\n  This information comes from those on the ground, the ones who are \nseeing this misguided rule in action. As a direct result of having \nfewer and fewer small, medium, and local lenders in the home mortgage \nbusiness or offering capital for their neighbor's small business to get \noff the ground, the CFPB's rule has put the American Dream out of reach \nfor thousands across the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, today we have to rightsize government regulation to \ncreate more opportunity. We have the opportunity to encourage small- \nand medium-sized financial institutions in our local communities to \nkeep their doors open, to make mortgages again, to make loans to would-\nbe entrepreneurs, in short, to fund the dreams of their neighbors and \nfriends.\n  We have an opportunity to expand, not the law, but rather, and \ninstead, the number of Americans who can own a home or start their own \nbusiness.\n  I first introduced the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act when I \ncame to Congress in 2015. It is a bill that would keep the original \nintent of the 1975 law. Nothing will overwrite or exempt any financial \ninstitution, big or small, from reporting data related to race and \ngender. It is a bill that will put a stop to the loss of small- and \nmedium-sized lenders by providing desperately needed regulatory relief \nfor Main Street banks and credit unions.\n  I am pleased to say it is a bill that has been perfected with the \ninput from both sides of the aisle, present company excluded, and in \nboth Chambers. Our goal today shouldn't be to expand the law. Our goal \ntoday should be to expand the number of Americans who want to get one \nstep closer to achieving their American Dream, whether it is owning a \nhome or starting a business.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is our goal, and today we can take a big step \nforward in reaching that goal. If my fellow colleagues share this goal, \nthen I urge you to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2954, and pass the\n\n\nHome Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act."], "Ms. TENNEY": ["2018-03-07", "  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Rome Elks.\n  Hailing from Rome Elks Lodge #96 on Liberty Street, our hometown Elks \ntruly embody the mission the Elks National Foundation has been \ncommitted to for over 140 years. For generations, Elks around the \nNation have dedicated themselves to building strong communities and \nlending a helping hand to their fellow neighbors.\n  Today I would like to recognize an outstanding group of hometown Elks \nwho have made the journey from Oneida County to visit us here in \nWashington: Donna Townsend; Whitney Cook; Mary Bielby; and retired \ncaptain of the Rome Police Department, John Bielby.\n  Our Elks in Rome and around the country help our youth develop \nlifelong skills, assist students who are attending college, support \ncharitable work in their communities, and care for our local veterans.\n  However, Rome Elks are unique to all other Elks in the country. In \naddition to the honorable work of the Elks, Rome Elks also carry out \nthe longstanding tradition of caring for the gravesite of a historic \nRome native, Sir Francis Bellamy. Some of you may not know it, but Sir \nFrancis Bellamy is the author of our uniquely American tradition, the \nPledge of Allegiance.\n  Francis Bellamy was born in Mount Morris, New York, attended our Rome \npublic schools, and graduated from Rome Free Academy, affectionately \nknown as RFA, in 1872.\n  Every day throughout our country, in public and parochial schools; at \nBoy Scout and Girl Scout meetings; at American Legions and all \nfraternal and patriotic organizations; in government, including here in \nour Nation's Capitol, millions of Americans recite the Pledge of \nAllegiance.\n  The Pledge of Allegiance reminds our citizenry of the notion of what \nit means to be American. We pledge allegiance to this great experiment; \nto our constitutional Republic, a nation that reveres freedoms, \nindividual rights, and liberty. We pledge allegiance to our country's \nhistoric Judeo-Christian values.\n  Bellamy wrote the Pledge of Allegiance in 1892 at the age of 37. \nDuring his time working as a writer for a magazine called ``The Youth's \nCompanion,'' a family magazine that, at the time, had 500,000 \nsubscribers, Bellamy was tasked with creating a patriotic school \nprogram to honor the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival \nto America. Through this assignment, the Pledge of Allegiance, as we \nknow it today, took shape.\n  At a trying time in our Nation's history, Francis Bellamy captured so \nelegantly and simply America's unity and loyalty. With only a sentence, \nBellamy ultimately symbolized America's ability to surpass all internal \ndifferences. It is the manifestation of our patriotic conscience and it \nis recognized throughout our Nation.\n  Francis Bellamy's spirit pervades in Rome to this day, especially \nduring patriotic holidays, like Flag Day. On Flag Day, the Rome Elks \nreplace the two American flags that fly over Sir Francis Bellamy's \ngravesite. These annual ceremonies are a dedication to the patriotic \nprinciples that our flag has stood for since it was first adopted in \n1777. In 2008, the Rome Elks started a significant renovation project \non Bellamy's gravesite, and completed it 1 year later, just in time to \nrededicate it for Flag Day.\n  In addition to their work in honoring Sir Francis Bellamy and the \nAmerican flag, the Rome Elks are also well known for their commitment \nto helping our local veterans.\n  Recently, the Rome Elks held a fundraiser to raise money for therapy \ndogs for veterans through a local organization called Clear Path for \nVets. As part of the fundraiser, the Rome Elks took flags that had \nflown over Sir Francis Bellamy's gravesite and removed the stars and \nstripes. They then individually separated and added a slip of paper \nwith the words ``This little star is proud to say I flew over Bellamy's \ngrave.'' The Rome Elks call this project ``Stars Over Bellamy.''\n  They started with 300 of these little packets, but quickly added 200 \nmore when they realized how popular this projects was. To date, the \nRome Elks have raised over $1,000 for this fundraising effort. One of \nthe most touching aspects is that every veteran that a Rome Elks member \ncomes across receives one of these stars for free as a thank-you for \ntheir years of service.\n  I was lucky enough to be able to purchase a star for myself and a few \nothers for my son, who is currently serving in the Marine Corps. It is \na constant reminder for me of the legacy Francis Bellamy left for our \ncountry, as well as the patriotic principles I as a member of the Ilion \nElks Lodge #1444--a nearby Elks Lodge down the street--have come to \nlive by.\n  These are just a few examples of the hard work and devotion that the \nRome Elks show for their community. The Rome Elks bring so much more to \nthe community than just a building. Although it is a beautiful, \nhistoric building on Liberty Street--aptly named--in Rome, New York, \nthey invest in programs that help children grow up healthy and drug-\nfree, meet the needs of today's veterans, and improve the quality of \nlife for our area.\n  As I mentioned, as a member of the nearby Ilion Elks Lodge #1444, I \nam proud to know and work with so many outstanding Elks and members \nthroughout our region. I also am excited to participate in our \nbenevolent Elks Lodge, which has a motorcycle ride each year, where we \ntravel to each of the Elks Lodges and raise money for charities that \nhelp many of our veterans in need.\n  So I just want to say, if you happen to be visiting our region, take \nthe time to stop by one of our wonderful Elks Lodges. They have weekly \nevents. Particularly in the Rome Elks Lodge, they have Tuesday Wing \nNight, Wednesday Night Spaghetti Supper, Fish Fry Friday, or one of our \nspecial events on the weekends or holidays. It is really a beautiful \nand wonderful time to meet and have fellowship with a community that is \nso patriotic and so devoted to our Nation.\n  Today I urge all my colleagues and anyone watching at home to thank\n\n\nElks Lodges from around our Nation for the tremendous work they do for \nour communities, especially our veterans. Or, better yet, take the \nopportunity to volunteer at an Elks Lodge or consider joining an Elks \nLodge. They do so much great benevolent work for our communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n"], "Mr. SMITH of Texas": ["2018-01-18", "  Mr. SMITH of Texas.

He runs the Houston Shoe Hospital in \nmy hometown of Sugar Land, Texas. It is right there at the corner of \nWilliams Trace and State Highway 6. For 10 years, I have taken my boots \nto be shined at that store.\n  I have talked to Justin about what the Tax Code and the cuts will do \nfor his business. He said:\n\n       It is simple. More money in my pocket means I will pay off \n     all my credit cards and all our debt.\n\n  But most importantly, Justin met his bride in Mexico. They were \nmarried there. With all this new money he has because of our tax cuts, \nhe plans to take his two kids to the same church where they were \nmarried to baptize them in the Lord, Jesus Christ. That is priceless. \nThat has happened because of these tax cuts.\n  A second story and face that comes to mind is a dear friend, Andres \nNovoa. He is the owner of a Fort Bend County icon, La Cocina Mexican \nRestaurant, right there off of Highway 357.\n  He told me that the biggest benefit to his business is that he can \npay his employees more--more money in their pockets. He can expand his \nbusiness. He can get new equipment. He said the last 4 years of high \ntaxes and the exploding regulations have caused a small retraction in \nhis business. He is now in full expansion mode. He is giving his \nemployees more pay and has plans right now to buy more equipment.\n  And there is more.\n  Andres is the heart and soul of an annual fundraiser for seniors' \nMeals on Wheels in Fort Bend County. Every Cinco de Mayo, when Mexico \ncelebrates their independence from France, he has a fundraiser at La \nCocina. Last year, he raised over $60,000. With more money in his \npocket, he thinks he can have a bigger party and maybe raise $100,000, \nor maybe purchase a new van to deliver food.\n  This is a picture of Andres. He is smiling because he was talking \nwith us about those amazing tax cuts. He is just one more picture.\n  I invite America to check out Justin's and Andres' story at my \nwebsite, my Facebook page, or on Twitter. Hear their voices. See them \nspeak. Learn what they have learned.\n  I will close with a request from Justin and Andres. They want me to \nsay thank you to President Donald Trump and thank you to every Member \nof Congress who voted for this bill.\n  This bill is not about crumbs. This bill is about real money in real \npeople's pockets. I invite everyone to come down to Houston, Texas, in \nSugar Land, and get your boots shined at Houston Shoe Hospital.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to encourage folks at home, folks in \nthis body, folks wherever they may be scattered across this country to \nspeak out against what the administration has proposed with regard to \nraising tariffs on steel and aluminum. At the end of the day, I believe \nit would be disastrous not just for the economy at large, but, frankly, \nfor every one of us in the way that it would impact our pocketbook or \nour wallet.\n  In short, what I guess I am saying is that you don't have to do \nstupid to find that stupid is indeed stupid.\n  What I am getting at here is that we have had real-world experiments \nabout once every 100 years in this country on these kinds of policies.\n  It was in 1828 that you had the so-called tariffs of abomination, and \nit was designed to supposedly protect jobs and protect industry. It \nproved to do neither. It actually proved to be disastrous for the South \nand, in particular, South Carolina, where I am from.\n  About 100 years later, you had the Smoot-Hawley tariffs that were \nequally disastrous in not producing what they were supposedly designed \nto do. They didn't protect jobs, didn't protect industry, and, in fact, \nworld trade declined by about two-thirds during that time period.\n  So as a country, what I am suggesting is that we need to take a \nbreath, we need to look before we leap.\n  In life, I would say there is a value to listening to the advice and \ncounsel of others. In this case, Gary Cohn, the President's chief \neconomic person, who is actually leaving based on this dispute, has \nsaid this is not a good idea. Steelworkers unions have said this is not \na good idea for the way it will impact Canadian steel and, by virtue, \nAmerican steel. The markets, which are sort of the collective opinion \nof what we all think is going to come next economically, dropped 600 \npoints on Thursday and Friday, saying this is not a good idea. In fact, \nthe Prime Minister of Sweden was here yesterday, and he was saying it \nwas not a good idea.\n  A lot of folks have spoken out and said: This is a genuinely bad \nidea. Let's not move forward.\n  I would say further that, in negotiations, rescue teams shouldn't be \nthe ones shooting the hostage.\n  In this case, we have our Cs mixed up. The administration talks about \ndoing something about China, but, in fact, the group--the country--most \nimpacted would be the Canadians. The Canadians have to be some of our \nstaunchest allies over a long period of time, with us in war, with us \nin trade, with us culturally; yet the bulk of all steel that is \nimported to the United States comes from Canada and 50 percent of what \nwe export in steel goes to Canada.\n  Let me put it this way: what I am saying is that what we need to do \nhere is to trust our allies. If you walk into a bar and somebody says, \n``If you take one step closer, I am going to hit you in the face,'' we \nneed to trust them that they are telling the truth. And\n\n\nwhat they said is: If you do this to us, we are going to do it to you.\n  In short, a trade war will ensue.\n  I remember watching a movie back when I was in high school or \ncollege, somewhere along there, called ``War Games,'' and basically \nwhat it said was: the only way to win was not to play.\n  If we move forward, we are going to get hurt. Nobody wins in a trade \nwar.\n  Finally, I would say this: in life, it is easier to burn down than to \nbuild up. You can take years constructing something and have it gone as \na consequence of a match in a matter of moments or hours.\n  As we look at this, this administration, in conjunction with the \nCongress, has worked hard to construct a better environment for jobs, \ncapital, and way of life with the tax cuts, with regulatory reform; but \nall that could be erased if we move forward with these tariffs.\n  More telling is the 70-year apparatus that has been created--over 70 \nyears, since the time of World War II--that had us engage with the rest \nof the world, and we see movement in the wrong direction.\n  Do we want better trade?\n  Yes.\n  Can there be changes that are made?\n  Yes. But this is not the answer.\n  A tariff, at the end of the day, is a tax.\n  My simple presumption and my simple ask of this administration, the \nask of everybody in talking about what is occurring here, is to say: \nLet's not increase taxes as a way of ``protecting jobs and capital in \nthis country.''\n"], "Ms. BARRAGAN": ["2018-03-08", "  Ms. BARRAGAN.

The aggregate benefits of Federal \nregulations is between $219 billion and $695 billion; whereas, the \naggregate costs are $59 billion to $88 billion. Many regulations spur \ninnovation that benefit the economy as well as human health.\n  Now, it is no surprise to me that this administration and the \nRepublicans are targeting air pollution regulations. The OMB noted that \nEPA rules ``account for over 80 percent of the monetized benefits and \nover 70 percent of the monetized costs'' of Federal regulation between \n2006 and 2016.\n  Since regulations protect human health and safety and have more \nbenefits than costs for industry, I stand in opposition to bills like \nthis one that seek to undermine these protections.

Mr. President, probably every single one of us in the \nSenate would agree that it is hard to get here, it is hard to stay \nhere, and it is wonderful to be able to accomplish something worthwhile \nwhile you are here. That is why I am here today--because I want to call \nattention to an announcement that was made this morning by a bipartisan \ngroup of U.S. Senators and the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, \nwhich could take away\n\n\nthe $11.6 billion of national park maintenance backlog in the 417 \nnational parks that we have. The proposal we made this morning could \neliminate that backlog over the next 10 years.\n  I want to give Secretary Zinke and the President a lot of credit for \nthis because they have agreed to do something that no other President \nand no other Secretary of the Interior have ever agreed to do, as far \nas I know, and that is to allow us to use revenues from energy \ndevelopment on Federal lands as mandatory spending to pay for the \nmaintenance backlog in our National Park System.\n  Ken Burns called our national parks ``America's Best Idea.'' I would \nsay that the best idea to support America's best idea is the proposal \nthat Secretary Zinke has made to take care of the maintenance backlog \nin our national parks.\n  Half of that maintenance backlog is our roads. Of course, when we pay \nfor the roads this way, that means all the money that is now being \ntaken away from all the other purposes at our national parks--I am \ntalking about the National Mall, where I get up in the morning and walk \nevery day, or the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where I walk \nwhen I go home on the weekends--could be used for other purposes there, \nin all 417 of those parks.\n  If we don't do this, we will never catch up because this backlog--\nthis $11.6 billion backlog--is four times the annual appropriations for \nthe National Park Service. Everyone who cares about our national \nparks--and that should be almost every American--should welcome this \nproposal.\n  As I said, our use of Federal dollars in this way is unprecedented, \nbut the principle is not unprecedented. The principle is a very simple \nprinciple, and that is this: If we create an environmental burden, \nwhich energy exploration does, whether it is wind turbines or whether \nit is spreading solar panels all over hundreds and hundreds of acres or \nwhether it is oil and gas exploration. If we create an environmental \nburden, we should create a corresponding environmental benefit. That \nprinciple is well established in our laws and has been supported by \nalmost every major environmental and conservation group I know of.\n  Let's start with the 1962 Outdoor Recreation Resources Review \nCommission that Laurance Rockefeller chaired. That Commission, which \ntook a look at America for the next generation to see what we should do \nto protect the outdoors so we could all enjoy it, recommended, and the \nCongress adopted, the idea of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \nThere was a Federal side and a State side. Over all of the years since \n1964, $18 billion has been spent in the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. That is the environmental benefit. Where did the money come from? \nIt came from drilling on Federal offshore properties.\n  In 1986, I chaired President Reagan's Commission on Americans \nOutdoors. We reaffirmed our support for the idea that an environmental \nburden means we should have an environmental benefit. We urged Congress \nto make permanent the funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \nSo we reaffirmed that again for the next generation.\n  Then, in 2006, with the leadership of Senator Domenici, Senator \nBingaman, and others--many of us worked on it--Congress decided we \nwould take some of the revenues from new drilling in the Gulf of Mexico \nand apply those to the State side of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund--again, an environmental burden and a corresponding environmental \nbenefit.\n  That is why this proposal is so exciting to me. That is why this \nproposal has such strong bipartisan support.\n  In the Senate, the supporters include Senator King of Maine, Senator \nDaines of Montana, and Senator Heinrich of New Mexico. It is a \nbipartisan group. Supporters also include Senator Capito and Senator \nManchin, Senator Gardner and Senator Tillis; all of us support and are \ncosponsoring this legislation we are introducing today.\n  In the House of Representatives, we also have two cosponsors. \nCongressman Mike Simpson of Idaho, who is chairman of the House Energy \nand Water Development Subcommittee, and Congressman Kurt Schrader from \nOregon is also a cosponsor in the House of Representatives.\n  So I believe this is an unprecedented day; for all of those who care \nabout and love our national parks and who have struggled to imagine how \nwe can deal with this $11.6 billion maintenance backlog--a backlog that \nis four times the annual appropriation--we can pay this all off with \nthis proposal, which is supported by the President and his Office of \nManagement and Budget, a bipartisan group of Senators, and a bipartisan \ngroup in the House.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell \nin the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Hopefully, it can be \nmoved promptly through that committee. There are other important things \nwe would like to do, but I can't think of anything much more important \nthan our National Park System.\n  I mentioned a little earlier that we have 417 national parks in the \ncountry. I grew up camping and hiking in one of those, and I live \nwithin 2 miles of that park. It is the Great Smoky Mountains National \nPark. It has more visitors than any other national park--nearly twice \nas many as the closest one. Eleven million people a year come to the \npark.\n  Many of my best memories are from that park. I remember, when I was \n15 years old, my dad dropped me and a couple of other boys at the \nhighest point of the park, Clingmans Dome, one day around \nChristmastime. There was 3 feet of snow. He said: I will pick you up in \nGatlinburg. Well, he did, and that was about 8 or 9 hours later.\n  Later that same year in the summertime we were camping on Spence \nField. That is at about 5,000 or 6,000 feet as well. We had taken \nblueberry pancake mix up there. We picked the blueberries. We had all \nof the materials for a good breakfast, but we made one mistake. We left \nthe breakfast in our packs in the tent, and during the night a bear \ncrawled in there with us, took it out, and we ended up on top of the \ntrail shelter banging the pans together trying to run the bear off. \nThat was the last time we left our breakfast materials nearby the \nsleeping area when we were camping in the park.\n  The park is a good place for lessons and learning and appreciating \nbeauty. It is a good place for the rich. It is a good place for the \npoor. Parents bring their children out of a digital diet to feast on a \nworld of natural splendor. We learn our history in a place where \nhistory comes alive; not just the history of the world but the history \nof East Tennessee, the history of Wyoming, the history of Maine, the \nhistory of Montana.\n  Let me give my colleagues a sense of just what this $11 billion \nbacklog means. I have already said it is nearly four times what the \nNational Park Service receives in annual appropriations. We can talk \nabout the Smokies alone. Between Tennessee and North Carolina, there is \nabout a $215 million backlog of projects; 75 percent of that is roads. \nWe get nearly twice as many visitors as any other park. These visitors \ncome to see our majestic views. They spend 400,000 nights camping in 9 \nfrontcountry campgrounds and 100 backcountry camp sites.\n  In 2013, the park had to close Look Rock Campground and the picnic \narea due to funding shortfalls in replacing the water treatment \nfacilities. In order to open this recreation area for visitors, the \npark needs $3 million to replace the water treatment facility, repair \nthe road infrastructure, and replace aging picnic tables and campground \npads. This proposal could do that.\n  The funding provided in the National Park Restoration Act, which is \nwhat we call our legislation, could help reopen this campground for the \nenjoyment of the over 11 million visitors to the Smokies.\n  The Smokies also supports a vast trail system, with almost 850 miles \nof maintained trails for hikers, backpackers, and visitors. The current \ndeferred maintenance backlog for trails in the Smokies is $18.5 \nmillion. This proposal would take care of that.\n  In August 2017, I visited the Smokies with Interior Secretary Ryan \nZinke, and I saw firsthand with him the work that is needed on the \ntrails. We hiked the Rainbow Falls Trail, where a 2-year project is \nunderway to rehabilitate the trail.\n  Crews from Trails Forever, a partnership between the Great Smoky \nMountains National Park and the Friends of\n\n\nthe Smokies, and the American Conservation Experience are working to \nbuild a rock staircase along the trail to reduce erosion and improve \nvisitor safety and enjoyment.\n  Crews use rigging systems to move large rocks, split them using \ndrills and chisels, and then set them into place to provide long-\nlasting trail structures for those hoping to see the rainbow formed by \nmist from the 80-foot waterfall along the Rainbow Falls Trail.\n  Secretary Zinke and I worked to split and place one of those rock \nsteps. It is not very easy to do. Volunteer crews will work to \nrehabilitate over 6 miles of that trail.\n  In addition to the crews, every Wednesday volunteers head up the \ntrail to help restore it for future visitors. In 2017, volunteers \ndonated 900 hours of work on that trail.\n  The Smokies is full of wonderful volunteers like those working on the \nRainbow Falls Trail. Over 2,800 volunteers donated over 115,000 hours \nlast year alone, but we must do more to get the funding to our parks to \nhelp address the maintenance needs and support the countless \nvolunteers.\n  In the Smokies, 75 percent of that maintenance work is roads, which \nisn't surprising, since millions of visitors to the park each year \nexperience it behind the wheel. The park maintains and operates nearly \n400 miles of roads, including 6 tunnels and 146 bridges, which allow \nvisitors to traverse the park's mountainous landscape.\n  The Smokies is working hard to address these maintenance needs, and \nlater this year they will open 16 miles of the Foothills Parkway. We \nare all looking forward to that in East Tennessee. Driving the \nFoothills Parkway will give you a spectacular view of the highest \nmountains in the Eastern United States. Tennesseans are excited that \nthese new 16 miles of the parkway will soon be open to the public. It \nis scheduled for this fall.\n  Due to funding shortfalls, building and repairing the 16-mile stretch \nof the Foothills Parkway took over 50 years and will be completed \nnearly 75 years after Congress first authorized the Foothills Parkway. \nCompleting just 1.6 miles of the parkway took nearly 30 years.\n  In 1944, Congress authorized the Foothills Parkway but prohibited \nFederal funds from being used to purchase and acquire the land, so the \nState of Tennessee purchased the land and gave it to the Federal \nGovernment to create a scenic parkway to provide views of the Great \nSmoky Mountains National Park.\n  For 75 years, Tennesseans and visitors have been waiting to enjoy the \nmajestic views of the Foothills Parkway because there hasn't been \nsufficient Federal funding to address the maintenance needs of our \nnational parks. Other roadways in the Smokies, including Newfound Gap \nRoad and Clingmans Dome Road, remain on this backlog list.\n  Clingmans Dome Road takes visitors to Clingmans Dome--the highest \npoint in Tennessee and the third highest mountain east of the \nMississippi. At 6,643 feet, Clingmans Dome offers panoramic views of \nthe Smoky Mountains.\n  Additional funding is desperately needed for the Smokies and all of \nour National Parks to help repair and rebuild campgrounds, trails, and \nroads. Doing that will bring more visitors, more tourists, and more \njobs to Tennessee and to national park communities throughout our \ncountry.\n  According to the Outdoor Industry Association, the outdoor recreation \neconomy generates 7.6 million direct jobs and $887 billion in consumer \nspending. In Tennessee, the outdoor recreation economy generates \n188,000 direct jobs and over $21 billion in consumer spending.\n  In 2016, the visitors to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park \nalone spent nearly $950 million in communities surrounding the park. \nThe over 11 million visitors to the park supported nearly 15,000 jobs \nand $1.3 billion in economic output in these communities.\n  Restoring our parks not only helps to preserve our land for \ngenerations but helps to grow our economy.\n  Now, here is what our bill does. I see the Senator from North \nCarolina is coming to preside, and he is one of the principal \ncosponsors of the bill. The National Park Restoration Act will use \nrevenues from energy production on Federal lands to help pay for the \n$11 billion maintenance backlog at our national parks. It will provide \nmandatory funding on top of annual appropriations for the National Park \nService--for the priority-deferred maintenance needs that support \ncritical infrastructure and visitor services at our parks.\n  The National Park Restoration Fund created by the legislation will \nreceive 50 percent of revenues from energy production on Federal lands \nover the 2018 projections that are not already allocated to other \npurposes.\n  This legislation includes revenues from all sources of energy \nproduction on Federal land: oil, gas, coal, renewables, and alternative \nenergy.\n  The legislation protects all existing obligations for revenues from \nenergy production on Federal land, including payments to States, \npayments to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and payments to the \nReclamation Fund.\n  Finally, I want to acknowledge the work that Senators Portman and \nWarner have done. They have introduced similar legislation. They have \nmany of the same objectives. I know there are many other Senators who \ncare deeply about this issue, other than the bipartisan group of us who \nintroduced the legislation today. We can all work together in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee where this bill will be \nreferred. We will put our heads together with Senator Murkowski and \nSenator Cantwell. We will come out with the best possible bill--\nsomething that President Trump can continue to support and that the \nfull Senate and then the House of Representatives can pass. Then, we \ncan get on with it and begin to deal with the deferred maintenance \nbacklog in our national parks.\n  Theodore Roosevelt once said that nothing short of defending this \ncountry in wartime ``compares in importance with the great central task \nof leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is \nfor us.'' We must all work together to restore our national treasures \nso future generations have the same opportunity to enjoy them, as we \nhave.\n  In conclusion, let me reiterate something personal about this. In \n1985, the Secretary of the Interior called and asked me, when I was \nGovernor of Tennessee, to chair the President's Commission on Americans \nOutdoors. I did that, along with Gil Grosvenor, the chairman of the \nNational Geographic Society, and a variety of people. One of our major \nrecommendations was to pick up the recommendation of the Rockefeller \nCommission from 1964, which said, if there is an environmental burden, \nthere should be an environmental benefit. They are the ones who \nrecommended, to begin with, that we take land from energy exploration \nand use it to pay for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  We reaffirmed that in 1986. We reaffirmed that principle in 2006 when \nwe used revenues from drilling for the State side of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  So while this proposal is unprecedented in the sense that it is the \nfirst time that I know of that a President and his Office of Management \nand Budget have approved mandatory funding using revenues from energy \nproduction on Federal lands to deal with national park maintenance \nneeds, the principle of matching an environmental burden with an \nenvironmental benefit is well established.\n  I am grateful to the President, and I am especially grateful to \nSecretary Zinke for his initiative. I look forward to working with a \nbipartisan group of Senators in the Energy Committee to develop a bill, \npass it, and get started on the work of America's best idea for \nrestoring America's best idea--our National Park System."], "The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bergman)": ["2018-02-07", "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bergman).

Our Republican colleagues say: \nWe don't have the money to fund these programs, but somehow they were \nsilent on that issue when they gave a handout to giant corporations \nthat add more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit.\n  While their donors rested peacefully over the holidays knowing that \ntheir tax cuts were safe, Republicans continued to torment 800,000 \nhardworking young people by refusing to pass the Dream Act. 122 \nDREAMers lose their protected status every day, and Republicans have \nnot been brave enough to do what is right.\n  These courageous individuals are teaching in our schools, working in \nour communities, and serving in our military.\n  I have had the privilege of meeting DREAMers in south Florida and in \nthe Halls of this Capitol.

Madbury is a classic New \nEngland community, proud of its rich history, its tradition of direct \ntown meeting democracy, and its family-friendly quality of life. \nAdmittedly, I am not an entirely objective observer, as Madbury has \nbeen my home for nearly four decades. It is where I raised my family \nand have so many dear friends, and it is where I first got involved in \nlocal politics, serving on the town's zoning board. The roughly 1,800 \nresidents of Madbury look forward to a nearly yearlong celebration of \nthe anniversary, beginning with a special observance at our annual town \nmeeting on March 13.\n  Of course, the human history of what is now Madbury--located today in \nStrafford County in southeast New Hampshire--goes back many centuries \nprior to the arrival of the first English explorers and settlers. In \nthe 17th century, the Native American Chief Moharimet convened counsels \nin this area, and today our elementary school is named in his honor.\n  Madbury was originally a part of the settlements of Dover and Durham \ncalled Barbadoes, named after the West Indies island of Barbados, where \nlocal settlers sent lumber in exchange for sugar and molasses. It was \nnamed for the English town of Modbury, the ancestral home of Sir \nFrancis Champernowne, who immigrated to what is now Madbury in the \n1640s. Madbury was incorporated as a parish in 1755 and as a town in \n1768.\n  One of our early residents was Major John Demerritt, who in 1774 \njoined with other New Hampshire patriots in storming the King's Fort \nWilliam and Mary in New Castle, seizing its armory of weapons and \ngunpower. The ``Powder Major,'' as he came to be known, stored a \nportion of this armory at his farm, which still sits on Cherry Lane. It \nwas later used by revolutionaries at the Battle of Bunker Hill.\n  Our Madbury town flag--thought to be the first town flag in New \nEngland--features an ax, a plow, and a rose. The ax represents \nforestry, which first attracted settlers to Madbury to supply \nshipbuilders at Dover, Durham, and Portsmouth. The plow symbolizes our \nagricultural past. The rose symbolizes the former Elliot rose nursery, \nwhich in the mid-20th century boasted the longest greenhouse in the \nworld at 1,400 feet in length.\n  Madbury is proud of its long and rich history, and we entered the \n21st century as a forward-thinking community with a vibrant economy. \nThough surrounded by industrial areas, Madbury has remained largely \nrural in character, proud of its small town charm, hospitality, and \nlifestyle.\n  I look forward to celebrations of Madbury's 250th anniversary later \nthis year, including a parade and other festivities on Madbury Day in \nJune and a Revolutionary War reenactment in the fall.

Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2, the \nAgriculture and Nutrition Act, known as the Farm Bill. This bill \nweakens our ability to fight hunger, undermines conservation efforts, \nand fails to address the needs of small and family farms.\n  The Farm Bill should provide a safety net for both the hard-working \nfarmers who produce food and those who consume it. In the past, \nbipartisan Farm Bills have met the needs of both rural and urban \ncommunities and have found a balance in the policies that support \nfarmers and those facing food insecurity. Unfortunately, this year \nRepublican leaders on the House Agriculture Committee halted a \nbipartisan effort and brought a very partisan bill to the floor. The \nproposal is the result of an ideologically-driven process that was \nrushed and inadequate, leaving farm and food programs in jeopardy.\n  More than 80 percent of the funding in the Farm Bill supports \nnutrition assistance programs for the nearly 41 million Americans \nfacing food insecurity. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \n(SNAP) allows low-income families to purchase food, and the program \ncontinues to play a critical role in helping these families escape the \ndevastating effects of poverty. This program is vital for families in \nOregon and across the country. According to a Census Bureau report, \nnearly 20 percent of families in Oregon rely on SNAP. Unfortunately, \nthe Agriculture and Nutrition Act would slash more than $23 billion in \nSNAP benefits, removing food from the tables of tens of thousands of \nhungry Oregonians, and an estimated one million households nationwide.\n  Additionally, because SNAP is tied to eligibility for federal school \nmeal programs, this bill would cut access to free school meals for an \nestimated 265,000 low-income children each year. This cruel and \nneedless policy will result in additional hunger. Children need \nnutrition to learn and thrive and succeed in school, and hungry \nchildren are more likely to stay trapped in poverty.\n  Under current law, able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 49, \nwithout dependents, are only eligible to receive SNAP benefits for \nthree months every three years, unless they are employed or in training \nfor at least 20 hours per week. This bill would expand these \nrequirements, harming many older low-income Americans and ignoring the \ncaregiving responsibilities and other barriers to employment that many \npeople face. SNAP provides some of our most vulnerable populations with \naccess to affordable food; it is not and should not be a workforce \ntraining program.\n  The bill would also eliminate the ``Heat and Eat'' program, which \nallows Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) participants \nto receive a modest standard allowance so families do not need to \nchoose between paying their energy bills and having access to food. \nThese cuts would threaten many families, children, and seniors in \nOregon and across the country.\n  The Farm Bill should provide support for farmers and ranchers who are \nstruggling to make ends meet because of low market prices for goods, \nhigh production costs, and significant market uncertainty. This is \nespecially important in light of the trade disruptions and tariff tit-\nfor-tat initiated by the current Administration. Unfortunately, the \nAgriculture and Nutrition Act would fail to raise reference prices for \nmost traditional crops to address the continued decline in farm income, \nlimiting support for those who need it the most.\n  Northwest Oregon is home to many organic and specialty crop farmers, \nand I am disappointed that this bill did not increase funding for \nSpecialty Crop Research Initiative and Specialty Crop Block Grant \nProgram, programs that help a wide variety of food producers such as \nblueberry and hazelnut farms,\n\n\nas well as vineyards producing world-renowned wines. The bill also \nneglected to increase funding for research into organic farming \npractices, an area that has demonstrated tremendous growth and that \nharbors further potential.\n  Our state exports a large majority of its agricultural products. Even \nwith market uncertainty as a result of inconsistent messages and a \nchanging narrative from the Administration, this bill failed to \nincrease funding for the Market Access Program, the Foreign Market \nDevelopment Program, and the Emerging Markets Program. The bill also \neliminates the Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program, which \nsupports robust local production and purchasing.\n  The bill also included troublesome language that would prohibit \nstates from establishing standards and conditions on agricultural \nproducts sold within their borders. This could preempt several state \nlaws in Oregon related to labeling malt beverages as beer, prohibiting \nthe sale and possession of shark fins, and prohibiting retaliatory \ndiscrimination in farm worker camps. Oregonians should have the right \nto implement standards around labeling and animal welfare and avoid \npurchasing out of state products that fail to comply.\n  Farmers are natural stewards of the land and have direct experience \nwith conserving natural resources. The Farm Bill should support those \nefforts, but it eliminates the Conservation Stewardship Program, \nslashing $795 million in conservation funding. The bill would also \nremove a requirement that the Environmental Protection Agency consult \nwith wildlife services to protect endangered species, fish, and \nwildlife from harmful pesticides. Further, it would reduce funding \nneeded to maintain the integrity of the National Organic Program and \neliminate existing bioenergy and renewable programs that support \nfarmers, ranchers, and rural businesses.\n  Finally, I am disappointed that my bipartisan amendment to legalize \nindustrial hemp and define it as an agricultural commodity was not \nallowed to come to the floor for a vote. American farmers have been \ngrowing hemp since the country was founded, and hemp products account \nfor more than $680 million in annual domestic sales. Thirty four states \nhave legalized hemp production, and legalizing it at the federal level \nwould bolster our economy and allow farmers and universities to \ncontinue researching and cultivating the crop. I will continue to work \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance federal \npolicies that support the hemp industry.\n  This bill fails to support hard-working farmers and takes away food \nassistance from the most vulnerable. We must do better for our \nconstituents. I am unable to vote in favor of increasing hunger and \nharming local farmers, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.\n"], "Mr. ESPAILLAT": ["2018-03-07", "  Mr. ESPAILLAT.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Ellison for \nthe time he has spent with us today opposing this legislation. His \nhistory is such that everyone understands that he represents the least \nof these, that he represents working people, that he represents poor \npeople. Whenever there is an opportunity to speak up for them, he \nalways does.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think we need to remember what this is all about, so \nlet me state the facts.\n  HMDA data allows us to monitor mortgage lending patterns to identify \nunderserved communities and populations to combat discriminatory \nlending.\n  HMDA data was used to determine when many of us suspected during the \nsubprime bubble that persons of color, particularly African Americans, \nreceived predatory subprime loans at higher rates than White borrowers. \nThey received these loans even when they qualified for prime mortgages.\n  The Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau have used HMDA data to bring fair lending cases against banks \nfor redlining, steering, and other violations of the Fair Housing Act.\n  It might be true that H.R. 2954 could provide relief to some \nfinancial institutions by exempting lenders from the updated HMDA \nreporting requirements. What is true is that the bill would likely also \nhave far-reaching adverse consequences for consumers, particularly \nthose in low-income census tracts and rural areas.\n  Equally disconcerting is that the reduced HMDA data could stop \nregulators' ability to identify and stop any emerging predatory or \ndiscriminatory practices faced by those consumers.\n  Borrowers who take out home equity lines of credit, the HELOCs, are \nat risk of losing their homes to foreclosure when property values \ndecline. In fact, the expansion of HELOCs in the mid-2000s contributed \nto the foreclosure crisis that many communities experienced in the last \n2000s.\n  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau noted that:\n\n       Had open-end line of credit data like HELOCs been reported \n     in HMDA, the public officials could have had a much earlier \n     warning and a better understanding of potential risk, and \n     public and private mortgage relief programs could have better \n     assisted distressed borrowers in the aftermath of the crisis.\n\n\n\n\n  While I am a longtime advocate for community banks, this bill does \nnot reduce burdens. All of the HMDA data points being discussed today \nwill continue to be collected by banks because they need this data to \noriginate mortgages for their customers.\n  I also understand that personal banking does not mean that \ndiscriminatory lending does not occur in smaller-sized institutions. In \nfact, the Obama administration's Department of Justice sued a community \nbank located in Chaska, Minnesota, with assets of $1.9 billion.\n  Mr. Speaker, you have heard the arguments.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I talked about immigrants \nDonald Trump doesn't really care for, like the Dreamers who were raised \nin the United States and are now vulnerable to deportation. Then there \nare the refugees from war and religious persecution. He doesn't really \ncare for them either.\n  Let's see, there are the people from El Salvador, Haiti, or Africa--\nthe people from shithole countries. Trump would rather deport than \nprotect them. And he doesn't want them coming here legally either.\n  No, as we all know by now, Trump prefers immigrants from snowhole \ncountries like Norway. Yep, you take a look at the Winter Olympics \nleaderboard of the countries that won medals and that is a pretty good \nlist of who Trump wants to have here. Norway, check. Canada, great. \nNetherlands, okay. And we better add Russia to that, too.\n  President Trump has been blocking any kind of immigrant legislation \nbecause he will only agree to protect Dreamers from deportation if he \ncan eliminate whole categories of legal immigration. And not just any \nimmigration, but specifically the programs that are filled with people \nwho want to come to the United States legally from Asia, Africa, and \nLatin America.\n  He is especially opposed to diversity in our immigration system, and \namong the programs he insists we eliminate is the one most often used \nby immigrants from Africa.\n  So Trump's immigration approach is pretty simple: If you are White, \nyou are all right. If you are Brown, you are a little lower down. And \nif you are Black, just go back.\n  The other group of people Trump is particularly angry about are \nfamily members of U.S. citizens--yes--and those who are on the path to \nbecoming U.S. citizens. He insists that we need to take away the rights \nof U.S. citizens to petition for their family members. Nope, Trump \nthinks U.S. citizens cannot be trusted to petition for their own family \nmembers, which is kind of strange because he doesn't have to look very \nfar to find an immigrant American citizen who petitioned--legally--for \nMelania's parents to come to the United States.\n  According to The Washington Post:\n  ``The parents of First Lady Melania Trump have become legal permanent \nresidents of the United States and are close to obtaining their \ncitizenship, according to people familiar with their status. . . .\n  ``Immigration experts said''--they--``very likely relied on a family \nreunification process that President Trump has derided as `chain \nmigration' and proposed ending in such cases.''\n  Remember, the in-laws are from Slovenia, and that country won two \nmedals at the Winter Olympics, so I guess they are okay. It is okay, \napparently.\n  Now, let us remember that the First Lady of the United States is here \nin this country because she applied for, and received, an \n``extraordinary ability visa,'' which is often called the Einstein visa \nbecause we give it to Nobel Prize winners. But I guess we also give the \nEinstein visa to musicians and artists and runway models.\n  The First Lady's extraordinary abilities are many, I am sure. Now, I \nwant you to recall that one of the issues in Jared Kushner's security \nclearance was that he owes so much money to foreigners, that some \npeople might be able to leverage that debt into an application for \nanother visa program just for millionaires and fat cats. Yes, in \nAmerica, if you have $1 million, or you look like $1 million, you can \nget a visa. But if you look like a parking attendant or a busboy or a \nfield hand or the king of Wakanda, in the eyes of our President, you \nare just not welcome in the United States of America.\n  Look, let me break it down from my perspective. This is not the \ncountry we aspire to be. My mother came from Puerto Rico with a fifth \ngrade education, and Puerto Rico has never won a gold medal at the \nWinter Olympics. But guess what? Her daughter--my sister--is a great \npublic school teacher and her son is a Member of Congress, and I think \nthat is what the American story should always be about.

The \nday is most commonly known as ``Black January'' due to the terrible \nhuman losses and subsequent military rule. 26,000 soldiers fired into \ncrowds of civilians targeting women, children, hospitals, and \nambulances. Fighting lasted for three days and resulted in 131 \nfatalities, over 600 injuries, 841 arrests where detainees were subject \nto torture, and to this day an unknown number are still missing. These \nhorrific acts did not have their desired effect in the slightest on \nAzerbaijan who won independence less than two years later.\n  The second occurred on this day, February 26, twenty-six years ago in \nthe city of Khojaly where several thousand ethnic Azerbaijani people \nwere trapped in a blockade by Armenian troops seeking to lay claim to \nthe Nagorno-Karabakh region. Citizens of the city were told that they \nmay escape if they left immediately but regardless, hundreds of \ninnocent citizens, including women, children, and the elderly, were \nbrutally murdered or taken prisoner on that day.

My bill would name the U.S. Post Office at \n567 East Franklin Street in Oviedo, Florida, in honor of one of its \nnative sons, Sergeant First Class Alwyn Cashe.\n  Scripture teaches us that there is no greater love than to lay down \nyour life for your friends. On October 17, 2005, in an Iraqi province \nnorth of Baghdad, Sergeant First Class Cashe made the ultimate \nexpression of love, disregarding his personal safety and enduring \nunimaginable pain in order to save multiple soldiers under his command \nfrom their burning vehicle after it hit an improvised explosive device.\n  His actions that fateful day were so remarkable that they almost defy \ndescription. Words like ``courage'' and ``bravery'' do not seem \nadequate to fully capture the deeds this soldier performed.\n  The actions that Sergeant First Class Cashe took resulted in his \ndeath, as he must have known they would. After his passing, Sergeant \nFirst Class Cashe received the Silver Star, the third-highest combat \naward that the Army confers.\n  Over the past years, there has been a passionate, painstaking, and \npatient effort to have Sergeant First Class Cashe's Silver Star \nupgraded to the Medal of Honor. Notably, this effort has been led by \nthe battalion commander who nominated him for the Silver Star. This \nindividual, now a two-star general, came to believe he deserves the \naward. I strongly agree with this conclusion.\n  But right now, I want to talk not about medals but about the man \nhimself, because that is what matters the most.\n  Alwyn was born in 1970 in Sanford, Florida, and was raised in Oviedo, \nattending Oviedo High School. He was the youngest of nine children--\nfive girls and four boys. The family didn't have much money, but they \nhad plenty of pride. When Alwyn was just 6, his father passed away. \nAlwyn's mother, Ruby Mae, worked long hours at demanding jobs, working \non an assembly line and, later, as a custodian at Florida Tech, since \nrenamed the University of Central Florida.\n  One of Alwyn's sisters, Kasinal, who is now an ICU nurse, describes \nher brother as the baby of the family, rambunctious, a little spoiled \nby his siblings, and, of course, deeply loved. She remembers buying him \na 10-speed bike so he wouldn't be different from the other kids in the \nneighborhood and how happy he was.\n  Alwyn enlisted in the military after high school. Kasinal told us it \nhad a transformational effect, turning this aimless boy into a resolute \nman, the civilian into a soldier--and not just any soldier, but a \nsoldier's soldier, a tough-as-nails infantryman, and an old-school \nleader in the best sense of the term.\n  As Kasinal put it, Alwyn bled Army green right from the start. The \nArmy gave him a second family with even more brothers and sisters, \nbound together by the American flag on their uniform and the events \nthey experienced and endured together, from boot camp to combat.\n  On October 17, 2005, Alwyn, now Sergeant First Class Cashe, was on \nhis second deployment to Iraq. The Bradley Fighting Vehicle carrying \nhim, six other American soldiers, and the squad's interpreter struck an \nIED. The blast instantly killed the interpreter and ruptured the \nvehicle's fuel cell.\n\n\n  Flames engulfed the vehicle. Initially, only lightly injured, but \ncovered in fuel, he descended into the hull, extracted the driver, who \nwas on fire, and extinguished the flames. At this point, multiple \nsoldiers remained in the vehicle, one of whom managed to open the rear \nhatch.\n  Sergeant First Class Cashe rushed to the back of the vehicle, reached \ninto the hot flames, and started pulling out soldiers. His fuel-soaked \nuniform caught fire and the flames spread quickly over his body. \nDespite what must have been terrible pain, he returned to the vehicle \ntwice more to extract his soldiers, all while he was still on fire and \nexposed to enemy gunfire.\n  By the time all the soldiers were saved from the vehicle, his \ninjuries were the most severe. Second- and third-degree burns covered \n72 percent of his body. Nevertheless, he refused to be evacuated until \nall his soldiers were medevacked out before him.\n  When he arrived at the U.S. military hospital at Balad Air Base in \nIraq, he was still fully conscious. What remained of his uniform had \nmelted to his skin, yet he tried to fight off the nurses, insisting \nthat they treat everyone else first. Despite determined efforts to save \nhis life at various hospitals abroad and in the States, he eventually \nsuccumbed to his wounds on November 8, 2005, surrounded by members of \nhis biological family and his Army family.\n  Sergeant First Class Cashe's actions reflect the highest standards of \nservant leadership, devotion to duty, and sheer bravery.\n  We cannot bring Sergeant First Class Cashe back or erase the pain \nfelt by those who loved him and those who served alongside him, but we \ncan pay tribute to his life and his legacy. We can engrave his name on \na plaque and designate a Federal building in his memory so the public \nnever forgets this American soldier, this son of Oviedo, who laid down \nhis life for his friends in service to our country.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this legislation.\n"], "Mr. VARGAS": ["2018-05-18", "  Mr. VARGAS.

There is a way. Congress can pass the \nDream Act, which restores protection for the DREAMers. The act provides \nfor undocumented American students who graduate from American high \nschools, who are of good moral character, have arrived in the United \nStates as children, and have been in the country continuously for 4 \nyears the opportunity to earn conditional permanent residency for 8 \nyears.\n\n\n  That seems absolutely fair to me, and I think to so many others.

He eventually made his way here to the \nHouse of Representatives in 2007 and, ultimately, became Deputy Chief \nReporter in 2015.\n  Ed took his role as our guardian of the public record very seriously: \nwith great integrity, with great professionalism, and with great \nrespect from everyone who had a chance to work with him.\n  And what do these Official Reporters do for us?

While not everybody farms, everybody eats. And \nwhenever I talk about agriculture to other people that don't have it in \ntheir district or in their region, I talk about how this farm bill is a \nnational security issue.\n  You see, when we grow our own food in this country, we control our \nown future. If we rely on another country to feed us, then they control \nus. And as we do business and trade with other countries, we create a \nmuch friendlier environment and neighborhood worldwide because we are \ndoing business with those countries.\n  We decided years ago in this country that we wanted to have an \naffordable and a safe food supply. And today, we have the safest food \nsupply in the entire world because this country has a farm bill--a farm \nbill that provides safety nets for our farmers and ranchers that are \nout there taking highly leveraged risks each and every year to put a \ncrop in the ground and to harvest that and to feed this country and the \nworld.\n  So maintaining control of our food supply--and the world's most \naffordable and abundant food supply at that--is essential. Because once \nwe depend on another Nation to feed us, then they will continue to \ncontrol us. So this is about having a safety net and making sure that \nevery single family in this country has affordable and safe food.\n  We do this in this bill by maintaining a strong crop insurance \nprogram. We remain committed to strong livestock disaster programs \nwhich were essential in making sure that South Dakota ranchers could \nrecover from that devastating Winter Storm Atlas that killed tens of \nthousands of cattle that we experienced. It helped them rebuild, and it \nhelped them continue to grow beef in our country.\n  Commodity programs are improved in this bill as well. I am proud that \nthe language I drafted was included to make these programs work better \nfor the future. We also increase investment in farm country. We \ndedicate resources for rural broadband development. We do this while \nalso investing in essential research opportunities, and continue to \ndrive innovation.\n  As a lifelong farmer and rancher, I understand the uncertainty our \nfarmers face every day. In fact, across the country and across my home \nState of South Dakota, farm income in the last several years has \ndropped over 50 percent. I know how highly leveraged farmers are, and \nhow important it is that we manage that risk.\n  We can't control all of the risk factors that these families face. \nHail storms and droughts will strike, but we can make sure that our \npolicies that we write here today enable them to fulfill our own \nnutrition needs while also feeding the world.\n  So I want to urge my colleagues to support this bill, to support this \namendment, and make sure that we continue to provide the food that \nfeeds the world.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time."], "Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts": ["2018-03-06", "  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts.

Genevieve, Missouri, is home to one of the largest collections \nof French colonial architecture in the United States and is one of the \noldest colonial settlements west of the Mississippi River dating back \nto the early 1700s.\n  For years, the community of Ste. Genevieve has celebrated its history \nand unique culture through numerous festivals and annual events. Over \ntime, the Federal Government has begun to catch on. One of the town's \nhistoric homes is a National Historic Landmark, several other homes are \non the National Register of Historic Places, and a large area of the \ntown itself is designated as a National Historic Landmark district, one \nof the oldest in the country.\n  In May of 2016, the National Park Service concluded and released a \nFinal Special Resource Study and Environmental Assessment for Ste. \nGenevieve. This study was the result of legislation\n\n\npassed over 10 years previously, which tasked the Park Service with \ndetermining whether or not the resources at Ste. Genevieve met the \ncriteria for inclusion in the National Park System. Happily, the Park \nService study concluded what the people of Ste. Genevieve already knew: \nthat Ste. Genevieve's large and unique collection of vertical log \nhouses rises to national significance. The study determined that \ncertain areas are suitable for direct Park Service management.\n  My bill is very straightforward: it establishes the Ste. Genevieve \nNational Historical Park as a unit of the National Park System; it sets \nthe boundaries of the park as depicted on the map laid out by the Park \nService; and it gives the Secretary of the Interior certain authorities \nwithin the boundaries of the Historical Park or any nationally \nsignificant property identified in the special resource study.\n  In order for the resources of Ste.

Mr. President, sometimes--not always--but sometimes \nCongress operates under the principle that anything worth doing is \nworth overdoing, and that, to some extent, is what happened with Dodd-\nFrank.\n  It has been almost 8 years since Dodd-Frank took effect, and in that \ntime, well over 1,700 community banks have consolidated, merged, or \nshut their doors forever. We are going backward. That is an average of \none every 3 days.\n  I was reading this morning that in the last 3 years, only 13 new \nbanks have been formed in America. That is not 13 per year, that is 13 \ntotal. Before Dodd-Frank, we averaged about 100 a year. Across America, \nbanks of all sizes have closed more than 10,000 branches. Acknowledging \nthe damage Dodd-Frank has wrought for our local economies is long \noverdue, and it is high time we did something about it.\n  In my State of Louisiana, out-of-control compliance costs have led to \nbanks boarding up their windows. That means, at this point in time, in \nat least 15 communities in my State, folks do not have access to a bank \nor to a credit union. For Louisianians living in these banking deserts, \ngetting a check or a savings account may be little more than a \npipedream.\n  I am not suggesting to you that everything in Dodd-Frank was \nmisguided. I think we had a handful of institutions that precipitated, \nin part, the meltdown in 2008, and Dodd-Frank regulates those \ninstitutions, but not every financial institution, particularly a \ncommunity bank and a small credit union, should be lumped in with the \nlarger financial institutions.\n  To return to my point, even the ordinary act of cashing a paycheck--\nsomething that goes sight unseen for most Americans--is next to \nimpossible without paying high fees at the convenience store, a pawn \nshop, or a payday lender. Because of the shrinkage in the banking \ncommunity in Louisiana, every day, ordinary Louisianians are being told \nto participate in the economy, manage their finances, save for their \nkids' future, and plan for their retirements when, thanks to Dodd-Frank \nand its overregulation of medium-sized and community banks and credit \nunions, too many Louisianians don't even have a bank branch in their \ncommunity.\n  I think it is time to swing the pendulum back toward simple, sensible \nregulations. We have legislation that will be on the floor this week in \nthe Senate that will do that. It is called the Economic Growth, \nRegulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. I call it the Dodd-\nFrank fix bill or the Dodd-Frank reform bill. It doesn't destroy Dodd-\nFrank. It doesn't eliminate it entirely. It just brings some common \nsense to the legislation. I think it is a vital step in the right \ndirection. Dodd-Frank, to some extent, particularly for medium-sized \nand smaller financial institutions, was like using a sledgehammer to \nkill a gnat. All our reform bill does is suggest that we ought to try \nusing a flyswatter instead of a sledgehammer.\n  The changes made in our bill will not mean the banks that are given \nrelief will go unregulated--far from it. They will still be heavily \nregulated. They just will not be overly regulated as a result of the \nDodd-Frank bill.\n  Everybody in America knows that community banks and credit unions, \nwhich I refer to as relationship bankers, played no role--none, zero, \nzilch--in the 2008 financial crisis. When former Chair of the Federal \nReserve Yellen testified during her term in office before the Banking \nCommittee, I asked her point-blank: Chairwoman Yellen, what did the \ncommunity banks\n\n\ndo wrong to contribute to the economic meltdown in 2008, and she \nresponded: Nothing.\n  The businesses of these small institutions revolve around lending. I \nam talking about community banks and credit unions. They lend to farms, \nmom-and-pop businesses, and homeowners. They are not hedge fund \nmanagers. They are not playing the margins. Yet the small banks are the \nones that are suffocating under the weight of Dodd-Frank's 20,000 pages \nof regulations. Let me say that again. Dodd-Frank is about a 900-page \nbill, and it has 20,000 pages of regulations.\n  Ultimately, our communities pay the price for the costs that have \nbeen imposed upon small- and medium-sized banks to comply with Dodd-\nFrank, when these banks did nothing wrong in 2008.\n  Studies show that when a bank branch shuts its doors, on average, the \nnumber of small business loans made in that community falls by 3 \npercent, and that has certainly been the case in Louisiana. The experts \nsay the neighborhoods can take more than 8 years to recover. You \nmultiply that by 10,000 branches that have closed across this country, \nand the figure is breathtaking. It doesn't take an economist to see \nthat the ultimate cost of Dodd-Frank on our communities in Louisiana, \nin Texas, and elsewhere has been job losses and economic decline.\n  Fortunately, I think we can start to see a light at the end of the \ntunnel--at least if our Dodd-Frank reform bill passes. Dodd-Frank, as \nyou know, said that all banks are created with equal risks and should \nbe subject to the same regulations. From the largest bank to the \nsmallest bank, they all create equal risk for the American financial \nsystem, and they should be subject to the same regulations. Whoever \ncame up with that rule must have parachuted in from another planet.\n  I am cosponsoring the Dodd-Frank reform bill because I believe an \ninternational bank--and I think common sense tells us this--with $50 \nbillion in assets poses a different risk to our economy than a \ncommunity bank in Bossier City with 30 employees. The Dodd-Frank reform \nbill acknowledges that banks come in all different shapes and sizes and \npurposes, and it treats them accordingly.\n  We have had 8 years under Dodd-Frank to see what this level of \ngovernment regulation means for our economy, and it is time to find \nsome balance. Dodd-Frank's purpose was to prevent another financial \ncrisis. Yet, in practice, banks across this country are now able to \noffer fewer products, fewer services, and fewer loans at much, much \nhigher prices as a result of overregulation by Dodd-Frank. If we want \nto get our economy back on track for working and middle-class \nAmericans, it has to stop.\n  I have been working closely with my colleague Senator Schatz on a \nbipartisan amendment to our Dodd-Frank reform legislation to protect \nconsumers. Americans shouldn't have to spend months fighting to correct \ninaccurate information on their credit report when they didn't consent \nto have it collected in the first place. They shouldn't be penalized \nbecause a credit reporting agency, such as Equifax, can't keep their \ndata safe.\n  Our proposal would require that the Big Three credit reporting \nagencies work together to create an online portal that gives consumers \naccess to their credit reports and their credit scores. This website \nwould allow folks to see what information has been collected about \nthem, see who has viewed their credit report and why, and opt out of \nhaving their information packaged and sold to third parties. It would \nmake it simple for people to dispute inaccuracies on their credit \nreports. In short, it would give consumers control over their financial \ninformation once again.\n  I respectfully urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this \nnecessary amendment.\n  To conclude, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer \nProtection Act--the Dodd-Frank reform bill that I have been talking \nabout--will help promote stability in our financial markets. It will \nprotect American consumers, and it will give breathing room to some of \nour smaller banks and to our credit unions. It will ensure that \nconsumers and small businesses continue to have access to mortgage \ncredit and to capital. I respectfully submit that it will help ensure \nthat our relationship bankers--95 percent of the bankers in America, \nthe ones on whose back this country was built--can afford to keep their \ndoors open and continue lending to the middle-class drivers of our \neconomy.\n  Thank you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Mr. LaHOOD": ["2018-03-06", "  Mr. LaHOOD.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my great frustration \nwith my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their reckless \nbehavior that is threatening the safety and security of the American \npeople.\n  Let me explain. Some Members of the House and Senate are holding \nfunding for the Federal Government, including funding for our Nation's \nmilitary, hostage in an effort to advance their immigration agenda.\n  I understand that immigration is a very important issue. I have many \npriorities in the immigration debate myself, like increased border \nsecurity. But I understand that there will come a time and a place to \ndebate immigration issues. That time is not now, and that place is not \non a bill dealing with funding our military and other essential \nfunctions of government.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is what the American people hate about Congress. \nInstead of simply doing one of our most basic jobs, funding the \ngovernment, we are having an unrelated debate about an immigration \nissue.\n  Let's be clear about what is going on here. Congressional Democrats \nare using our military men and women as pawns in a political game. They \nthink they can use funding for the military as leverage to get their \nway on a very complex immigration issue. I think that is not only \nwrong. I think it is irresponsible and it has very grave consequences.\n  I want to strongly reject the notion that this is a Republican \nproblem. The House passed a bill back in September, over 4 months ago, \nto fund the military and the entire Federal Government. That bill has \nbeen stuck in the Senate, where 60 votes are necessary to pass the \nbill. There are only 51 Republican Senators, so that means it will be \nnecessary to have bipartisan support to get any bill across the finish \nline. I vehemently reject this is an issue just facing congressional \nRepublicans. Frankly, that is a lie.\n  So why am I so passionate about this issue? Because our Nation's \nmilitary is facing a serious readiness crisis, and we as the Congress \nare making things worse. We have the smallest Army since before World \nWar II, the smallest Navy since before World War I, and the smallest \nand oldest Air Force we have ever had.\n  General Daniel Allyn, vice chief of staff for the Army, put it best \nwhen he said the budgetary problems have ``left the Army outranged, \noutgunned, and outdated. As a result, the Army risks falling behind \ncountries like Russia and China.''\n  There are similarly alarming quotes from the other services as well. \nOur military needs and demands funding certainty in order to make \npurchases and perform long-overdue maintenance.\n  Every time we pass a continuing resolution and kick the can down the \nroad, that hurts our military. It hurts the very men and women we send \ninto battle each day. It makes their job harder, and, frankly, it puts \nlives at risk.\n  We have seen fatal accidents aboard the USS Fitzgerald and USS McCain \ncaused by insufficient time to train sailors and maintain ships. We \nhave also seen fatal aviation accidents in the Marine Corps as their \nequipment ages and their training is limited.\n  The average age of Air Force aircraft is 27 years, and only 5 of 58 \nArmy combat brigades are ``ready to fight tonight.''\n  Continuing resolutions also hurt our taxpayers. In fact, the \nSecretary of the Navy recently said that the lack of funding certainty \nhas cost the Navy between $4 billion and $5 billion. It makes it \ncostlier to buy military equipment, and that added cost is \nultimately passed on to the taxpayer.\n\n  The threats we face today are so great. From China to Russia, to \nIran, to North Korea, to terrorist groups around the globe, we haven't \nseen this serious a threat environment since World War II.\n  What makes this issue even more frustrating is that both the House \nand the Senate, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan manner, have passed a \ndefense authorization bill showing our clear support for funding our \nmilitary at $700 billion. The bill passed with 356 votes in the House \nand on a unanimous voice vote in the Senate, yet we find ourselves at a \ndeadlock and our government on the verge of a shutdown because \ncongressional Democrats want to advance their immigration agenda.\n  Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. I know my colleagues may not like our \nPresident; I know my colleagues may not agree with me on immigration; I \nknow my colleagues have different priorities than I do; but for \ngoodness' sake, can we not at least agree that we\n\n\nshould adequately fund our troops and the Nation's military? Can we not \nat least agree that we shouldn't be playing political games with our \nmilitary men and women? We can save the political theater for another \nday.\n"], "Mr. CARSON of Indiana": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. CARSON of Indiana.

The ADA did not enable individuals to bring lawsuits \nagainst public accommodations for non-compliance; however, many states \nhave expanded these rights.

Contrary to what its supporters claim, H.R. 620 would \ncreate unnecessary hurdles for victims of discrimination to file an ADA \nclaim.

When \nMichigan became the 26th state admitted to the Union in 1837, Clemens's \nsettlement was incorporated as a village and then later voted to become \na city.\n  In the 1870's mineral water wells were discovered throughout Mount \nClemens and soon people from all over the world were traveling there to \nexperience the healing waters, including Hollywood stars Clark Gable \nand Mae West, and sports icons Babe Ruth and Jack Dempsey. Mount \nClemens became known as ``Bath City'' and the bath industry thrived in \nthis community.\n  The ``Capital of Macomb'', Mount Clemens, has a lot to offer its \nresidents and the surrounding communities. Not only is it the hub of \ncounty government and services, but Mount Clemens is also the center of \nmany cultural and recreational activities. It is home to vibrant \ninstitutions, including the Anton Art Center and the Crocker House \nMuseum, along with several other historical museums. From its parks and \nriverfront to its growing downtown, the city offers many community \nconcerts, festivals, and a weekly Farmers Market. And every Fourth of \nJuly, residents gather together for a bike parade through the \nneighborhood to celebrate the holiday.\n  Oakland University has a campus in downtown Mount Clemens, and the \ncity is home to two strong hospital systems, McLaren Macomb and Henry \nFord Macomb, and a community health center, MyCare. A favorite \ngathering place in the community is the Mount Clemens Public Library, \none of the two oldest public libraries in Michigan.\n  Over the years, I have been especially grateful to be able to spend \ntime with the students in Mount Clemens. Whether it's been playing \nbasketball with them at the Jermaine Jackson Community Center or \ntalking to the students at the High School about the civil rights \nmarches in Selma and the passing of the Voting Rights Act, I have seen \nfirsthand their passion and thoughtfulness about the community and \nabout important issues.

The \nRecovery Act provided funding for public safety and public housing \nprograms. And through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, the city \nwas able to purchase several blighted and vacant residential buildings \nslated for demolition and acquire property to become part of Clemens \nPark.\n  Money through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has helped \nimprove the Clinton River that flows through the city and supported \nhabitat improvements on the Clinton River Spillway that connects the \nClinton River to Lake St. Clair. We worked with the city of Mount \nClemens to get funding to dredge the Clinton River channel in downtown. \nAnd we joined with other members of the delegation to bring funding to \nreplace deteriorated sidewalks with pedestrian and bike trails.\n  Residents and leaders will gather on March 10, 2018, to celebrate the \npast, present and future of this great community. As the City of Mount \nClemens commemorates this milestone, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating the leaders, residents, churches, businesses, and \norganizations that make this\n\n\ncity so great. And I especially want to thank the residents of Mount \nClemens who have provided me with the honor of representing them in \nCongress for more than 25 years.\n"], "Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois": ["2018-02-26", "  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, let me just, first of \nall, commend Representative Burgess, chairman of the subcommittee, and \nMr. Green, as well as Representative Butterfield and all of the members \nof the Energy and Commerce Committee, for their leadership in bringing \nthis bill to this point at this moment.\n  As we just heard, sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder \ncharacterized by affected red blood cells that mutate into the shape of \na crescent or sickle, and, as such, these cells are unable to pass \nthrough small blood vessels. It is a recessive genetic condition that \noccurs when a child inherits two sickle cell genes or traits from each \nparent.\n  The consequences and complications of this disease are extreme. The \nSickle Cell Disease Association of America, with whom we have worked \nfor many years, has studied and reported that common complications with \nthis disease include early childhood death from infection; stroke in \nyoung children and adults; lung problems similar to pneumonia; chronic \ndamage to organs, including the kidney, leading to kidney failure, and \nto the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension; and severe painful \nepisodes.\n\n\n  In fact, pain episodes are a hallmark of sickle cell disease. They \nare unpredictable in many ways, both the timing of when they occur--how \nsevere they will be--and how long they will last. For those with the \ndisease, these devastating pain episodes can start as early as 6 months \nof age and can span a lifetime, impacting school attendance and \nparticipation in the workforce. In fact, these pain crises contribute \nsignificantly to the 200,000 emergency room visits collectively made by \nsufferers of sickle cell disease each year in our country. A typical \ncrisis will result in a hospital stay of 7 to 10 days.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have made a tremendous amount of progress in the \ntreatment, research, and effective ways of dealing with this disease. I \nnote that more than 20 years ago I worked with the project at the \nUniversity of Illinois running a sickle cell education project, and I \nhave seen much of that progress that we have talked about, but we still \nhave a long way to go. There is still tremendous need for research. \nThere is need for additional treatment modalities.\n  So, again, I thank all of those who have demonstrated support for \nthis important legislation. I urge its passage."], "Mr. LIPINSKI": ["2018-03-07", "  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Kendall Coyne of \nPalos Heights, Illinois, for winning a gold medal as a member of the \nUnited States Women's Ice Hockey team at the 2018 Winter Olympics in \nPyeongChang, South Korea. This is the first Olympic gold medal won by \nour women's ice hockey team since 1998.\n   From a young age, Kendall displayed extraordinary talent and skill \nat ice hockey. In 157 games over three seasons with the Chicago Mission \nunder-19 girls' team she scored 254 points and led the club to two \nleague championships. By 2011, Kendall's dominant performance had \nearned her a spot on the U.S. Women's National Team. As part of the \nnational team, she competed in the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia, \nwhere her strong work resulted in two goals and four assists. That team \nwon the silver medal, and when I met with Kendall to congratulate her \non her performance and that of the team, it was clear that she was \ndetermined to return to the Olympics in four years and finish on top of \nthe podium. And that is what she did. Once again reaching the gold \nmedal game against Canada, Kendall along with twenty-two amazing young \nwomen won a hard-fought 3-2 victory in a shootout to bring home the \nOlympic gold.\n   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating \nKendall Coyne and the U.S. Women's Ice Hockey team for their success. \nThey all have represented our nation with the utmost integrity on the \nworld stage. Hockey is a demanding sport that requires grit and \nperseverance. Ms. Coyne has demonstrated these qualities with true \ndistinction.

The majority whip."], "Mr. BLUNT": ["2018-03-07", "  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to join my colleague from West \nVirginia, as well as our friend from South Dakota, to say how much I \nappreciate the effort that Senator Crapo has made to put this bill \ntogether. It is exactly how the Congress is supposed to work and how \nthe Senate is supposed to work--a bipartisan bill. Frankly, I am sure \nit is a bill that everyone who will vote for it would have changed at \nleast one thing in it, but if we were to change all of those things \nthat all of us would have changed, suddenly we wouldn't have a bill \nthat could pass, a bill that would do what this bill does, a bill that \nwill roll back the Dodd-Frank regulations, which are one more attempt \nby the Federal Government to make one size fit all. If you have ever \ntried on any one-size-fits-all things, you know that one size almost \nnever fits anybody, and that has been the case that we have seen now.\n  Credit unions and community banks provide critical financial services \nfor families and for small businesses across Missouri and across the \ncountry. When the Dodd-Frank bill became law, small and medium-sized \nbanks and credit unions were faced with huge regulatory burdens. Big \nbanks got bigger, and small banks got bought and went out of business \nway too often. There was negative impact on their ability to maintain \nservice on Main Street in a small community. You couldn't put together \na group that would just be the compliance group, and if you did, that \nhad to come out of their ability to do the kind of business that you \nwanted to do and always had been doing.\n  According to the Independent Community Bankers of America, despite \nholding less than 20 percent of the Nation's banking assets, community \nbanks fund more than 60 percent of small business loans and more than \n80 percent of U.S. agricultural loans--all in that 20 percent of the \nbanking assets of the country. Furthermore, they operate in many areas \nwhere other banks don't, where they are the only physical banking \npresence, frankly. One out of every five U.S. counties has only one \nbank, and that one bank is a community bank, a small bank. The more \ntime, the more money, the more staff that community lenders have to \ndedicate to complying with needless regulations, the less ability they \nhave to provide the kind of service they would like to provide.\n  In talking about the bill that I am pleased to be a cosponsor of, the \npresident of the Missouri Bankers Association, Max Cook, said: ``This \ncommon-sense legislation will allow banks to better serve the needs of \ncustomers and businesses in our communities.''\n  He went on to say ``that financial regulatory reform will unleash \nAmerica's economic potential.'' That is the end of his quote, but I \nthink you could add to it that lots of good things are happening in our \neconomy right now--the tax bill, the regulatory, commonsense \nregulations that are overcoming regulations that didn't make much \nsense. Access to capital is a critically important part of what you \nhave to have to have a growing economy--access to capital in small \ncommunities,\n\n\nas well as access in big communities. That means you have to have banks \nthat can serve the communities those banks are in.\n  This bill contains a number of bipartisan priorities. One of the \npriorities in here is a bill that I sponsored, the Family Self-\nSufficiency Act. Senator Rounds mentioned part of what that means to \nrural Americans, but it also means a lot to Americans who are living \nunder public housing programs of one kind or another. This was a bill \nthat I introduced. It was cosponsored by Senator Reed from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Scott from South Carolina, Senator Menendez from New \nJersey, and it is another bipartisan statement that this bill will make \nwhen we pass it. It simply makes commonsense changes in the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development's Family Self-sufficiency Program. \nThat program happens to be under the Banking Committee, so it fits \nright in this bill.\n  What this addition to the bill would do--and it is in the bill to \nstart with now--is expand the ability of people, under the new way to \ndefine these programs, to improve their education, to save money for \nthe future, to reach their goal of becoming more financially \nindependent.\n  The first thing the legislation does is streamline two public housing \nfamily self-sufficiency programs into one. There is no reason to have \ntwo family self-sufficiency programs, no reason to have two \ndefinitions, no reason to have one category of people in those programs \nwho qualify for things and a second category who don't, just because \nthey happen to qualify under the definitions of a needlessly \nduplicative program. So it eliminates that.\n  This bill expands the scope of support services. It allows people who \nare in these programs to attain a GED if they don't have one, to pursue \na postsecondary degree or a postsecondary certification, and it gives \ntraining for financial literacy.\n  Lastly, this bill would expand the reach of the Family Self-\nSufficiency Program to families that may otherwise be technically \nexcluded from the program today.\n  I would like to share some of the statements from housing \norganizations in my State and around the country, such as a group \ncalled Beyond Housing, which is interested in more than just a place to \nlive, but how you use that as a way to improve your life. Beyond \nHousing in St. Louis, which provides more than 400 affordable housing \nrental units for families throughout the St. Louis region, endorsed the \nbill because they said it would ``empower families across the country \nto achieve self-sufficiency.'' The Missouri chapter of the National \nAssociation of Housing and Redevelopment Officials supports the change \nthis bill has because they say ``it provides the Tool Box the residents \ncan use to better life for them as individuals and as a family.''\n  The National NeighborWorks Association says that the legislation \nwould ``improve the existing self-sufficiency program to help more \nindividuals and families achieve more in life for themselves and their \nfamilies.''\n  Providing families in need with affordable housing is critical, but \nit is also important that we figure out ways to move them beyond \ngovernment support to self-sufficiency. These changes in this bill help \nmake that happen. A companion bill of that part of the bill in the \nHouse passed in January by a vote of 412 to 5, so I hope it is a \nhelpful addition to the bill. I know it is going to be helpful to the \nfamilies that it opens new doors for.\n  I am glad to be here supporting this bill and to have Senator Rounds, \nSenator Capito, Senator Enzi, and Senator Fischer here, as well, to \ntalk about the importance of this bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor."], "Mr. TILLIS": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I had not planned on talking about the \nbill we have before us, S. 2155, but the other day I was listening to \nanother Member speak, and this Member was talking about how this bill \ncould threaten and possibly increase the predatory practices of people \nwho had mobile home loans.\n  As a person who had a mobile home loan and somebody who lived in a \nmobile home park, I thought I would try to speak maybe about the \npractical easing--what we are trying to accomplish with this bill. The \ntruth is, I would go further on regulatory tailoring than we have. We \ndidn't because we wanted bipartisan agreement on this bill, which we \nhave.\n  As a matter of fact, I thank the members on the Banking Committee who \njoined with me and other members to make sure we kept the bill tailored \nenough so we had bipartisan support.\n  On mobile homes--we get out here in the Senate, and we talk about \nfacts and figures. I can talk about the fact that half of my community \nbanks have ceased to exist in North Carolina since the crisis. I can \ntalk about a number of people I speak with who can't get loans, but \nwhat I thought I would talk about is my own personal experience as a \n16-year-old, 17-year-old kid living in a trailer park working with my \nfather.\n  He would do maintenance work. If a house caught on fire or there was \nsome sort of insurance damage, he would work with the insurance \ncompanies to actually do repair work, and I was his handyman when we \nwould do these projects. We did not have a whole lot of money. My \nfather didn't have a lot of cash on hand, so the way we did it is, when \nyou had this insurance job, you bid on the insurance job. You knew how \nmuch money you would make at the end. Then you go to a bank and get \nwhat is called a 90-day note. Most of these projects were about 60- to \n90-day projects, and you would go to a banker whom you had built a \nrelationship with, and you would ask them to trust you to get this \nproject done. You would show them the project you were doing, and he \nwould underwrite a loan that you had to pay back in 90 days. That is \nwhy they called it a 90-day note.\n  Today, in the postcrisis world, that virtually never happens. Today, \nwe don't have community banks and personal banking relationships that \npeople can rely on to get access to capital. Even worse, with all the \ncommunity banks and smaller banks consolidating, ceasing to exist, \nthere are entire areas of North Carolina--a lot of people think North \nCarolina is an urban State. The fact is, about half our population, \nabout 5 million people, live in rural areas. They have been hardest hit \nby the consolidation of banks and the ceasing to exist of these sort of \nlending institutions out in communities like the community I lived in \nwhen I was 17 years old. They are not getting the money they need to \nmake ends meet.\n  What this bill is trying to do is recognize that, of course, after \nthe financial crisis, there was a regulatory exposure we needed to \naddress. The problem is, we simply went too far or at least with the \npassing of time we now know we can claw back those regulations on \ncertain banks--particularly community and regional banks. That is all \nthis bill is intended to do.\n  As a matter of fact, this bill allows the regulators to go back after \nthose banks that are under the $250 billion threshold if they determine \nthat the practices they are involved in are particularly problematic or \nmay have a systemic impact on the financial system as a whole.\n  What we are trying to do is make sure we start seeing community banks \npop up in rural areas like the place I lived in outside of Nashville, \nTN, where bankers could work with people and give them the resources \nthey need to pay their bills. Even as late as just a couple of years \nago--we have some folks who are speaking against the bill who said it \nwas important for us to advance these sorts of changes. As a matter of \nfact, one Member said: ``It is important we advance this conversation \nto ensure that prudential regulations for regional banks are crafted \nappropriately.'' That is what this bill does.\n  Another Member or maybe the same Member said: ``We all agree that \nregional banks are not systemically important.'' Regional banks are the \nbigger banks. They would be like BB&T or Fifth Third Bank.\n  They are not systemically important. Well, then, I guess we can all \nagree that the community banks and smaller banks aren't. That is what \nthis bill is about, some of the midsized regional banks and community \nbanks. We said we need to tailor it, and that is what this bipartisan \nbill does.\n  Another Member said: ``I continue to believe we will not be \nsuccessful in providing regulatory relief to institutions of any size \nif we don't have broad, bipartisan consensus.'' That is what this bill \nhas.\n  We always talk about the polar environment here and how we can get \nnothing done. This is a bill that has had members of the Committee on \nBanking, on which I serve, join together to make sure that all we \nadvanced out of the committee was a bipartisan consensus for regulatory \nrelief that allows cash to flow to people who need it--community banks, \nregional banks that have a more intimate relationship with people who \nneed access to capital. That is what this bill does. For the life of \nme, I can't understand why we can't all agree.\n  You have these discussions here where it sounds like we are doing \nsome big-bank relief--not at all. I have a couple of large banking \ninstitutions in North Carolina, and they are going to have to continue \nto submit 60,000-page, 100,000-page stress tests and CCAR reports to \nmake sure they don't create a\n\n\nsystemic threat. This bill doesn't touch that.\n  What this bill touches is a part of the ecosystem that is suffering. \nWhat this bill does is reduce the regulatory burden so that guy who \nexisted back in the midseventies who would give my dad a 90-day note \ncan now do it and not have to say no because they simply can't afford \nto do it either because it affects their portfolio or because they are \nspending so much money on regulatory relief that they have to go after \nthe bigger loans. It is the people at my level at that time back in the \nseventies who suffer.\n  This is a bipartisan bill, it is a responsible bill, and it is a bill \nthat is going to provide much needed relief.\n  I thank the Members on both sides of the aisle who recognize that \nthis is a prudent bill, that it is measured. I thank Chairman Crapo for \nall the great work he has done to live up to his commitment to the \nMembers on the other side of the aisle to keep this tailored and to do \nexactly what we said we were going to do. I look forward to its \npassage.\n  I yield the floor."], "Mrs. CAPITO": ["2018-03-07", "  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe bill we have in front of us, the Economic Growth, Regulatory \nRelief, and Consumer Protection Act. That is a mouthful right there, \nbut what it is, is a culmination and reaction to the Dodd-Frank bill \nthat was passed in 2010 as a result of the crisis of 2008 and 2009.\n  I think it is important for us to note where this is directed. In \nDodd-Frank, so much of the focus was placed on large banks and larger \ninstitutions, but what has been lost in the debate and what really is \nan unintended consequence, I think, is that the massive and burdensome \nregulatory legislation would affect the smaller banks, the community \nbanks, and the credit unions.\n  Senator Rounds of South Dakota and Senator Blunt of Missouri and my \nState of West Virginia have more rural areas for the most part, and \nthese community banks and credit unions are absolutely critical to our \nindividuals but also to our businesses. They have been bearing the \nbrunt of Washington's response to that in the form of Dodd-Frank.\n  We know that larger financial institutions have the capital, \nresources, staff, and expertise to handle a lot of these regulatory \nrequirements that are placed on them, but smaller institutions have \nreally struggled under the weight of Dodd-Frank. We didn't come to this \npoint today without a lot of discussion, compromise, and thoughtful \ninput from a lot of different entities to figure out the best way to \nserve all our States. These smaller institutions play a critical role \nin a State like West Virginia. Our small businesses rely on them to \nopen and succeed, our communities rely on them to expand, and our \neconomy relies on them to grow, especially in our rural areas.\n  Our community banks and credit unions really had to shift their \nattention away from what they know best, which is relationship-based \nlending and borrowing, and put it more into this regulatory environment \nto devote bank resources, time, energy, effort, and legal resources to \nmake sure they are complying with regulations that were really intended \nfor larger financial institutions. It has been tough.\n  From 2010, which was the year Dodd-Frank was enacted, until 2016, the \nnumber of community banks in our country has decreased by 1,600. That \nis a significant decrease in the number of community banks. With little \nor no access to community banks, our Main Street borrowers have been \nforced to turn to larger institutions for loans. That is fine, but a \nlot of times our Main Street businesses and individuals get lost in the \nshuffle. Sometimes it is stiffer terms, and sometimes it could mean \nrejection.\n  We are talking about farmers, families looking to buy a home, and of \ncourse our small businesses. We are really talking about the hard-\nworking men and women trying to live that American dream.\n\n\n  With smaller institutions constantly forced to merge with larger ones \nto help shoulder the cost of regulation, that relationship-based model \nthat has served our communities for decades is disappearing.\n  I think it is time now, after much thought, to ease that burden and \nrightsize those regulations on our smaller financial institutions, and \nthat is exactly what the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and \nConsumer Protection Act does. It is a balanced approach to regulation. \nIt takes into account the differences--some of them vast differences--\nbetween larger and smaller financial institutions.\n  It improves access to mortgages, which is something I have been \ninterested in since my service in the House when I was on Financial \nServices and I chaired the Financial Institutions Subcommittee. The \nmortgage issue was something that I introduced, and we worked on many, \nmany pieces of legislation to provide rural areas with greater access \nto mortgages.\n  Let's just talk about what happens. If a young couple is trying to \nget a mortgage or maybe it is even a med student coming out of medical \nschool, trying to get a mortgage for a loan with no real income yet but \nin a relationship banking situation, that small community banker knows \nthat is going to be a safe bet at the end of the day. A lot of our \nmortgages have been so constructed by Dodd-Frank that people haven't \nbeen able to get mortgages. Let's face it. The ones who face the \nbiggest challenges are the ones we were supposed to be trying to help \nwith Dodd-Frank, and those were in the mid to lower income range who \nmaybe had a credit issue or some other extraneous issue. In a cookie-\ncutter environment, one-size-fits-all doesn't fit their size, and they \nend up without the opportunity to own a home.\n  There are also very critical consumer protections in this bill--\nprotections for our seniors. I am going to go out on a limb here and \nsay that this is probably one area in which we haven't, as a Congress, \njoined together with financial institutions and other consumer \nadvocates to protect our seniors from being preyed upon financially. It \nis rampant. Sometimes you are preyed upon by your own family. So the \nSenior Safe Act, which is Senator Collins and Senator McCaskill's bill, \nprotects our seniors from financial exploitation--this is part of the \nbill--and fraud. This has been a consistent priority of mine.\n  It also works to protect our veterans, who can be very vulnerable \nwhen seeking financial assistance, and also for individuals who have \ngone through tough times financially. The legislation clarifies a lot \nof the CFPB regulations to help benefit those consumers.\n  Student borrowers and student loans--we talk a lot about the \nincreasing debt that our students are incurring, the difficulty that \nstudents, after they graduate, have in paying down these debts, but a \nbill that I helped to introduce with Senator Peters is included in this \nagreement. It says that when student borrowers from private loans have \nthe opportunity, they can rehabilitate their credit following a \ndefault. They can't do that now. If you have a government loan, you can \ndo that, but if you have a student loan through a private institution, \nyou can't do that. So we are seeking parity between a government loan \nand a private loan, and we think this will help those students repay \nand relook at their finances.\n  Finally, in light of recent data breaches that have put many at risk, \nthis legislation puts in place important cyber security standards and \nsafeguards. Every committee we are on talks about cyber security. The \nfinancial institutions, I think, have been on the leading edge of \ntrying to detect cyber invasions into information or into their \nfinancial institutions. We have to stay one step ahead here because \nthis is very fast-moving.\n  These are all priorities and solutions on which I have worked hard, \nboth as a leader on the House Financial Services Committee and now, as \nI chair the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations \nSubcommittee.\n  For community financial institutions, regulatory relief and economic \ngrowth go hand in hand. We just passed the tax relief bill, and a lot \nof our small businesses are able to increase their bottom lines, grow \ntheir businesses, grow jobs and wages. We want to see those financial \ninstitutions grow alongside that.\n  Working men and women and small business owners deserve a fair shot \nat mortgages. Owning a home is the American Dream. They also deserve a \nprocess that takes into consideration the kind of community where they \nlive.\n  We deserve relief from these burdensome and unbalanced regulations we \nhave been forced to contend with for too long. The Economic Growth, \nRegulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act does just this. It gives \nus an opportunity to send a clear message to Main Street, and that is: \nWe support you. We support you.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to stand with me. I want to thank \nChairman Crapo for his dedicated insistence that this come to the floor \nof the U.S. Senate and that we have bipartisan support. It is very well \nthought-out. It doesn't have the whole kitchen sink in it. It has the \nprovisions that I think are the top priority for our financial \ninstitutions but also for all of us who represent Main Street here in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor."], "Mr. LANKFORD": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, let me tell you about Farmers State Bank \nof Allen, OK. I know exactly where Allen, OK, is. I bet a bunch of \nfolks in this room do not. It is a small town, and this a small bank. \nThere is $43 million in total assets in that bank. That is a pretty \nsmall bank, as banks go. It is located in a town of about 900 \nOklahomans in total. The town has a number of small business owners, \nfarmers, and ranchers--folks that some people in this room fly over. \nThere are good families who live in that great town. Many of them have \ngreat credit scores and have a good family history of repayment back to \nthe bank when they have taken loans, because that is the bank in town. \nThey have been longtime customers of this bank. In many instances, the \nbank employees and the people in the bank have grown up together. They \nknow each other, but they also understand seasonal income.\n  When you are a farmer and rancher who doesn't come in with a W-2 \nevery single week or every month--it comes in seasonally--they \nunderstand the credit restrictions there.\n  A banker, named Debbie, at the Farmer State Bank of Allen wrote me \nthis and said:\n\n       Between the Ability to Repay and Global Cash Flow analysis, \n     particularly for a bank of this size, these new rules take \n     our time away from doing what needs to be done--caring for \n     our customers.\n       We have 12 employees and we're treated the same as JPMorgan \n     Chase, or Goldman Sachs--both of which have an entirely \n     different business model of operating. They do not operate in \n     towns of 900 [people]. . . . That's not their business model \n     or their kinds of markets\n       One of our key employees now spends most of her time on \n     compliance issues. Total costs for this employee, together \n     with the cost of the annual compliance audit [and everything \n     that goes with it is], now exceeds $100,000 annually.\n\n  Again, folks in big towns may not think it is a big issue to have \n$100,000 in appliance costs, but the total net income of this bank for \nthe year is right at $500,000 a year, and $100,000 of it is now spent \non compliance.\n  How did this happen? This happened when Congress decided in 2010 to \npass something called Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank was a bill signed into law \nin July of 2010 to deal with the financial crisis that happened in 2007 \nand 2008, which was real. The largest banks in our country took some \nincredible risks. It caused a financial domino effect all over the \ncountry, and it caused great risk for our international markets.\n  In response to that, Congress rose up with a strong Democratic \nmajority, and President Obama ran to it and said: We need to do \nsomething.\n  They looped together as many different financial restrictions as they \ncould. They created a new thing called the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, with no oversight at all. They created a whole \nlitany of new regulations and said: This will only be for the biggest \nbanks because they were the violators.\n  They put it out there, and then the regulations started flowing after \nthat. Guess what. Farmers State Bank of Allen, which was not the cause \nof the financial collapse in America, is now caught up, and they are \nstruggling to survive as a bank. Because Congress decided they were \ngoing to do something, the something ended up being something that is \ndevastating rural economies in my State.\n  Since the passage of Dodd-Frank, we have seen a 16-percent decline in \nthe total number of Oklahoma bank charters--just in my State. There is \na 35-percent decline in Oklahoma charter banks with less than $100 \nmillion in\n\n\ntotal assets since Dodd-Frank. The effects of Dodd-Frank were felt \npretty quickly in Oklahoma. It was passed in 2010. By the 2013-to-2014 \nreporting time, more than 40 percent of the banks in Oklahoma no longer \ndid mortgage lending at all.\n  Let that soak in for a minute--banks that don't do mortgages. If you \nare in a rural community, that is the bread and butter of normal \nlending in that community--going to get a mortgage. But 40 percent of \nthe banks in Oklahoma, starting in about the 2013, 2014 reporting \ncycle--just 3 or 4 years after Dodd-Frank passed--had already said the \ncompliance costs were so high and the complexity was so great that they \nno longer offered mortgages and mortgage lending.\n  There are folks who say: We will just drive to a big city and go to a \nbig bank and get it, and they will still take care of that. Quite \nfrankly, that is what is happening. Dodd-Frank has done an excellent \njob of increasing the size, power, and strength of the biggest banks in \nAmerica and has targeted the smallest banks in America. We are watching \nmergers all over my State, as the smallest banks struggle under the \ncompliance costs. It almost looks like the design of Dodd-Frank was to \ncause biggest banks to get bigger because the smallest banks would not \nbe able to survive under the compliance burdens that were then created \nfor them.\n  What does that look like in real life? Let me tell you about a \ngentleman who I bumped into early Monday morning. He was flying out of \nOklahoma. I was sitting next to the gentleman, and were striking up a \nconversation. He is a farmer and rancher in Oklahoma. He owns about 200 \nacres in North Central Oklahoma. He started to go through the purchase \nprocess to actually buy that acreage and couldn't get mortgage lending \nfor it. No banks in the area would do it. Why? The Dodd-Frank \nrequirements. Suddenly, a guy in Oklahoma trying to buy 200 acres had \nto find a way to scrape together $100,000 of cash to buy a ranch.\n  Now, 5 years ago, 10 years ago, or 15 years ago, if you wanted to get \nthat same ranch, you would go to the bank in town. Now the bank in town \nhas to tell you that you have to go somewhere else or find some other \nway to do it because the restrictions are so high that they can't do it \nanymore.\n  Local customers don't want to deal with someone else in another State \nor in another city. They would like to deal with their local bank, but \nthey can't anymore. Oklahoma's community banks had nothing to do with \nthe financial collapse in 2008. Yet they have been penalized all the \nway through this process.\n  In total, Dodd-Frank required more than 10 Federal agencies to write \nmore than 400 new rules, imposing 27,000 new mandates on financial \ninstitutions of every size. Just process that. When you are Farmer \nState Bank of Allen and you have 12 employees, you now have to track \n27,000 new mandates to keep up with it.\n  How are you doing with that?\n  That is what real life looks like. I have had folks say to me: This \nis some giveaway to the biggest banks.\n  What we are dealing with in this reform package is pretty \nstraightforward. The Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial earlier \nthis week saying that the bill ``eases administrative burdens on 5,000 \ncommunity banks that make up 98% of the financial institutions but only \n15% of the assets.''\n  Let me run that past you again. What we are dealing with deals with \n98 percent of the banks, but of total banking assets in the country, it \nis only 15 percent of the assets. That means the top 2 percent of the \nbanks in the country--the largest top 2 percent of the banks in the \ncountry--have 85 percent of the assets. I understand the higher \nregulations on those. They are significant. If they fail, they take \ndown the global economy. For the other 98 percent of the banks in the \ncountry that have only 15 percent of the total assets in the country--\nthese are the smallest banks in the country--why are they being dragged \ninto this?\n  All we want to say is to allow local banks to be local banks again \nand to be able to loan to their neighbors. These are the folks with \nwhom they go to church and are in Rotary Club, and with whom they have \ngrown up. They know their kids, and they know their families, but they \nare dealing with all these arcane requirements. They are dealing with \n27,000 new rules, and they just can't make it.\n  What does this look like in real life? Let me give you an \nillustration from Legacy Bank in Elk City. Damon, from Legacy Bank in \nElk City, OK, said:\n\n       As a community banker, my job has become much more \n     difficult and burdensome to our customers. Legacy has always \n     strived to offer the best customer service a bank can offer. \n     I used to be a lender to all. However, with the changes that \n     have come about with this bill, along with the fines and \n     penalties that are a potential and, at times, don't use \n     common sense, I am now a commercial lender only.\n\n  Let that soak in for a second. At Legacy Bank in Elk City, he used to \nmake loans to everyone, and now he is a commercial lender only. What \ndoes that look like in real life? I have folks who come to this floor \nand people who catch me and say: Banks are still making lots of money, \nand banks are doing just fine. Why is Dodd-Frank a problem?\n  Yes, banks are going to find a way to still do business. What has \nhappened? The biggest banks are loaning to corporate customers, and the \nsmallest banks that used to do small business lending and mortgages and \ntook care of their community can't do that anymore. So the big is \ngetting bigger and helping the biggest, and the small is not able to \nhelp the small.\n\n  I thought we were supposed to be a country that helped everyone--\ncorporations or individual farmers and ranchers and citizens who are \ntrying to start small businesses. Let's get back to doing that again. \nLet's not put 27,000 new restrictions on a small community bank and \ntell it that it has to abide by everything that JPMorgan Chase does and \ntreat it as if it is the same. It is not.\n  There is Frazer Bank in Altus, about which my wife and I have a \nlongstanding saying: Everywhere you go in the world, you are going to \nbump into somebody from Altus, OK. Try it sometime.\n  A local banker wrote: This past week in Altus, we had a local small \nbusiness owner who applied for a home mortgage loan. The customer had a \ndown payment and closing costs, but one of the key issues preventing \nour bank from making this personal loan was the time constraint of 2 \nyears of history. This is someone to whom we would have made a home \nloan prior to Dodd-Frank, but now we cannot.\n  So a small business owner with closing cost money and with an ability \nto repay is now blocked out. How serious is that?\n  Jim Hamby from Vision Bank in Ada wrote me and was trying to describe \nexactly what this looks like.\n  He made the statement: Overly prescriptive rules on mortgage lending \nare the big issue. The ability to repay and the rules governing that \ntopic are geared for people who are W-2 wage earners, not small \nbusiness people. Many small business people have already been denied \ncredit who would have otherwise qualified for a mortgage, and that is \nbad policy. Any mortgage bank keeps its own books and should \nautomatically define what is a qualified mortgage. This would help \nalleviate the ``ability to repay'' rule and allow us to take better \ncare of our customers.\n  Don't miss what he is saying there. The rules are written for people \nwho get a paycheck from week to week, not for the small business owner \nand certainly not for the farmers and ranchers.\n  Here is a statement from a banker in Northwest Oklahoma who asked a \nsimple question: What about a $60 million bank in the northwest corner \nof Oklahoma? What about other rural markets where smaller, traditional \ncommunity banks have completely abandoned lines of business and \nproducts because the cost of regulation makes it so unprofitable or \nbecause the price of regulation and risk from examiners and lawyers \nbring so much additional scrutiny that you can't afford it?\n  One thing is certain. When banks are forced to leave lines of \nbusiness due to government regulation, both customers and communities \nsuffer. Even in markets in which there are other participants in the \nabandoned product line, the reality is, with fewer competitors, \ncustomers pay higher rates and higher fees for a simple service.\n  This is not a hard issue. For the 2 percent of the largest banks that \nhave\n\n\n85 percent of the banking assets, I understand there is systemic risk \nthere. For the other 98 percent of the banks in the country that cover \n15 percent total of all of the banking assets in the country, why are \nthey considered so systemically important that 27,000 new regulations \nwould need to come down on their 12 employees?\n  This is a good moment in which to get small towns in rural America \nworking again and to allow people to go down the street to the bankers \nthey know and went to school with rather than to have to drive to some \nbig city and talk to the biggest banks in America and have them try to \nunderstand more about rural America.\n  We can fix this. I am looking forward to passing this reform and \nallowing our banks not just to make money--they will find a way to make \nmoney; they are businesses--but to actually get back to serving the \ncustomers they want to serve again in a fair way--farmers and ranchers \nand small businesses.\n  I yield the floor."], "Mrs. ERNST": ["2018-01-18", "  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues from \nOklahoma and Missouri, and we will be joined shortly by the Senator \nfrom Montana as well.\n  I am rising today to discuss the importance of protecting and \ncelebrating life.\n  As I travel across the State of Iowa, I have had the opportunity to \nhear directly from families whose lives have been changed by the \ninnovative, life-affirming services offered by their local pregnancy \nresource center. There are so many more stories of vulnerable lives \nsaved all across the country, not just in Iowa but all across the \ncountry.\n  I would like to begin by recognizing the critical, on-the-ground \nactions of these pregnancy resource centers, maternity homes, and \nadoption agencies across the country that are changing and saving \nlives. I want to thank them for all they do.\n  Since coming to Washington, I have tried to hold Congress accountable \nto do its part to protect the most vulnerable in our society. The \nSenator from Missouri has mentioned that we can measure a society, and \nours is a great society, but we can do more to protect those who are \nvulnerable. For example, last January, I introduced legislation to \ndefund Planned Parenthood while protecting women's healthcare centers. \nAs I have stated time and again, taxpayers should not be forced to foot \nthe bill for roughly half a billion dollars annually for an \norganization like Planned Parenthood that exhibits such disrespect for \nhuman life. Despite what they may claim otherwise, Planned Parenthood \nis not the Nation's preeminent provider of women's healthcare. For \nexample, Planned Parenthood facilities don't even perform in-house \nmammograms. They don't do that. Community health centers, on the other \nhand, continue to greatly outnumber Planned Parenthoods. They provide \ngreater preventive primary healthcare services, regardless of a \nperson's ability to pay.\n  Additionally, last April, President Trump signed my legislation into \nlaw that ensures States are not forced to provide entities like Planned \nParenthood--the Nation's single largest provider of abortions--with \nFederal title X dollars.\n  I am grateful to have worked with Congresswoman Diane Black, a dear \nfriend in the House; my Senate colleagues, who are with me here today; \nand President Trump to make sure States are not forced to award \nproviders like Planned Parenthood with taxpayer dollars through title X \nfamily planning grants.\n  Another effort my colleagues and I continue to work on is passing \nSenator Graham's Pain-Capable Unborn Children Protection Act in the \nSenate. Whenever I discuss this bill, I cannot help but share the \nremarkable story of a very special family from Newton, IA.\n  In July 2012, Micah Pickering was born prematurely at just 20 weeks \npostfertilization--the very age at which this bill would prohibit \nabortions. When he was born, Micah was only--if you can imagine it--\nabout the size of a bag of M&Ms, about the size of the palm of my hand. \nYet Micah was still a perfectly formed baby with 10 fingers and 10 \ntoes.\n  When I first met Micah, he was just a few years old, and he came to \nvisit me in my office. We had a photo of Micah when he was just born. \nAgain, folks, he was the size of the palm of my hand, a little bag of \nM&Ms. I had that photo in my office. Little Micah ran up to that photo, \nand he pointed at it and said: Baby.\n  And we said: Yes, Micah, that is a baby. That is a baby.\n  Just a few months ago, I had the opportunity to visit again with \nMicah and his parents in my DC office. I can attest that now at 5 years \nold, Micah remains a happy, healthy, energetic little boy. Stories like \nMicah's show all of us that at 5 months, an unborn child is a child--\njust as Micah would say--a baby.\n  There is also significant scientific evidence that at 5 months of \ndevelopment, these babies can feel pain. Yet there is no Federal law \nprotecting these vulnerable babies from abortion. As a result, every \nyear in our country, the lives of thousands of babies just like Micah \nend painfully through abortion. Currently, the United States is 1 of \nonly 7 countries to allow abortions at 5 months of gestation. We are in \nthe company of China and North Korea. Folks, this is unacceptable.\n  There is much work to be done in the ongoing fight to protect life. \nWe understand that. As folks from across the country travel to \nWashington to ``March for Life'' this week, I am urging my colleagues \nto join me in calling for a vote on this critical legislation that \nrecognizes these unborn babies as the children they are and provides \nthem the same protection from pain and suffering that all of our \nchildren deserve--again, as Micah Pickering would say, ``a baby.''"], "The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey)": ["2018-04-25", "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Oklahoma."], "Mr. WHITEHOUSE": ["2018-03-07", "  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the reason ``I came to speak on the \nfloor [right now is to talk] about an issue that many in Washington \nwould prefer to ignore; that is, [the] climate changes that are being \ncaused by our carbon pollution.''\n  That is how I began these speeches, with that sentence, on April 18, \n2012, from this desk. I have returned week after week to try to make \nsure there would not be silence in the Senate on the climate crisis. \nThis is my 199th weekly foray; next week will make it an even 200.\n  Back on that April Wednesday in 2012, debate about climate change had \nall but died in Congress. Just a few years prior, the House of \nRepresentatives had passed the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, led by \nour colleague, now the Senator from Massachusetts. In this body, \nRepublican colleagues had openly acknowledged the existence of climate \nchange and called for legislative action to cut carbon emissions. Since \nJohn Chafee, climate change had been a bipartisan concern.\n  In 2010, came the Supreme Court's disastrous Citizens United \ndecision, which allowed the fossil fuel industry to unleash limitless \ndark money on our elections. The polluters' money and threats cast a \nshadow across any Republican who might work on carbon pollution, and it \nended that bipartisanship.\n  When I gave that first speech, even the White House had thrown in the \ntowel on climate change, after letting Waxman-Markey die on the vine. \nYou couldn't get them to put the words ``climate'' and ``change'' in \nthe same paragraph, at least not until the President engaged on this \nissue in his speech in June of 2013. Washington had gone dark on \nclimate.\n  I knew I couldn't match the financial muscle of the big polluters, \nbut I believed if anything was going to change around here, we would \nneed to shine a little light on the facts and on the sophisticated \nscheme of denial being perpetrated by the polluters. I decided to put \nat least my little light to work, and I started these speeches.\n  The last 6 years, unfortunately, have offered no shortage of bad \nclimate news and dubious milestones. This chart shows the 4 hottest \nyears ever recorded have occurred since I began giving these speeches. \nGlobal warming is, of course, driven by the buildup of carbon dioxide \nand other greenhouse gases.\n  When I gave the first ``Time to Wake Up'' speech in April 2012, the \nconcentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was 396 parts per \nmillion. Today, it is at 408. It has never been so high in the history \nof the human species. It is not just the carbon dioxide in the \natmosphere that has been rising. So has the sea, as warming seawater \nexpands and glaciers melt, making our coasts--particularly in my Ocean \nState--ever more vulnerable to flooding and storms. The oceans are \nbecoming more acid, as ocean water reacts chemically with the \nheightened carbon concentration in the atmosphere.\n  During the 6 years I have been giving these speeches, the United \nStates has experienced more and more extreme weather events, many of \nwhich scientists tell us are linked to climate change: from deadly \nstorms, including 2012's Hurricane Sandy and 2017's Harvey, Irma, and \nMaria, to California's record drought and wildfires, to temperatures so \nwarm in the Alaskan Arctic that the computer algorithms thought the \nthermometer had broken.\n  In 2017 alone, the string of U.S. extreme weather disasters--six \nmajor hurricanes, wildfires in the West, catastrophic mudslides, \ntemperature records breaking all over the country--caused well north of \n$300 billion in damage and killed more than 300 people. The last 6 \nyears provide us with a menacing preview of things to come.\n  Scientists, including scientists at all of our home State \nuniversities, say these changes are driven by carbon pollution. Our \nnational security leaders warn of the increasing danger of \ninternational strife caused by climate change, as well as the threat to \nU.S. military facilities and force readiness.\n  Faith leaders urge us to protect creation and those less fortunate \nthan we are, led by Pope Francis, who, on this, has been magnificent. \nThe insurance and credit rating industries, whose business models \ndepend on accurate and responsible assessment of risk, warn us, as do \nmajor American corporations and leading investors--folks who can't let \nclimate politics interfere with their bottom lines. I have spoken about \nthem all.\n  I also visited States across the country to see for myself and to \ntalk to people firsthand--folks who know climate change is real because \nthey see it\n\n\nwhere they live, because they study it. In North Carolina, business \nleaders were organizing to protect the local coastal economy from \nclimate change and associated sea level rise. In South Carolina, tide \ngauges in Charleston were up over 10 inches since the 1920s. In \nGeorgia, I went out on the water with a clammer who showed me how \nchanges in climate are hurting his livelihood. In Florida, the Army \nCorps of Engineers officials in Jacksonville gave a dire presentation \nof what the sea level rise portends for the Sunshine State. In Ohio, I \nsaw the ice cores from faraway glaciers that record our looming climate \ncatastrophe.\n  In Utah, the ski resorts fear climate change will ruin their \n``greatest snow on Earth.'' I know the Presiding Officer takes pride in \nUtah's greatest snow on Earth. In Pennsylvania, child health \nspecialists from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia see climate \nchange worsening children's asthma. In Iowa, Des Moines Water Works was \nbusy preparing the city for more frequent and severe climate-driven \nflooding. In Arizona, they are changing the staffing for emergency \nresponders facing summer temperatures the human body cannot sustain. \nNew Hampshire is forecasting that its State bird may no longer be seen \nas its range moves ever northward out of New Hampshire on our warming \nplanet.\n  I traveled on to Texas, Iowa, Nebraska, Delaware, and more. I brought \nstories to this floor from every corner of the country, hoping \ncolleagues would heed the warnings from their own home States, to match \nwhat I was hearing from Rhode Island, from Rhode Island's coastal towns \nand scientists and fishermen: ``Sheldon, it's getting weird out \nthere,'' I was told. ``It's not my grandfather's ocean.''\n  Many Democratic colleagues joined me to discuss the changes they see \nin their home States, including 30 colleagues who held the floor all \nnight long in 2014.\n  In July of 2016, 18 Senators and I took to the Senate floor for days \nto expose the fossil fuel-funded front groups that were behind the \ncampaign to deny climate science and stymie legislative action. There \nis a whole carefully built apparatus: phony-baloney front groups that \nare designed to look and sound like they are real; messages honed by \npublic relations experts to sound like they are truthful; scientists on \nthe fossil fuel payroll whom polluters can trot out as needed.\n  This industry-fueled misinformation campaign has been a theme of \nthese speeches. I relayed the findings of researchers who study the \nflow of money through the climate denial network and the journalists \nwho uncovered Exxon's coverup of what they knew of the climate dangers. \nI compared the fossil fuel polluter playbook to the fraudulent tactics \nof the tobacco industry to bury the truth about the health effects of \ncigarettes.\n  I listened to conservative economists and offered market-based \nsolutions. Back in March 2013, I described the market failure of carbon \npollution's not being baked into the price of the product. Market \neconomics doesn't work when corporations can just offload their costs \nonto the general public. It is called a negative externality in \neconomics jargon, and we see it all around us in storm-damaged homes \nand flooded cities, in drought-stricken farms and raging wildfires. The \nbig oil companies and the coal barons have offloaded those costs onto \nsociety.\n  Virtually every Republican who has thought the climate change problem \nthrough to a solution comes to the same place: put a price on carbon \nemissions; let the market work; and return the revenues to the American \npublic. This concept is supported by a who's who of former Republican \nCabinet officials and Presidential economic advisers. I listened, and, \nin November 2014, I introduced with Senator Schatz the American \nOpportunity Carbon Fee Act to establish an economywide fee on carbon \ndioxide, return all of the revenue to the American public, correct the \nmarket failure, promote energy innovation, and, of course, dramatically \nreduce carbon pollution.\n  I have seen over the years of these speeches that the landscape is \nshifting. The Senate has actually held votes that show that a majority \nhere believes climate change is real, not a hoax, and is driven by \nhuman activity. It took years, but I guess that counts for progress \naround here.\n  Outside of Congress, the Paris Agreement in 2015 committed the \nnations of the world to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by \nreducing carbon emissions. America's part was the Clean Power Plan--to \nreduce carbon emissions from the power sector by one-third by 2030 from \n2005 levels.\n  Automakers adopted new fuel economy standards for cars and light \ntrucks in 2012. Vehicles would get nearly 55 miles per gallon by 2025, \nsaving consumers billions of dollars while eliminating billions of tons \nof carbon emissions.\n  The EPA issued new rules in 2016 to limit the flaring of methane--a \nmuch more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide--at oil and gas \nwells, and the Obama administration helped negotiate the Kigali \nAmendment to phase out the use of hydrofluorocarbons, which have \npowerful greenhouse gas heat-trapping properties in the atmosphere. \nSecretary Kerry convened wildly successful international oceans \nconferences, which are still ongoing and are scheduled for years ahead, \nto address the warming and the acidification of the seas.\n  In sum, up through 2016, even if Congress had been trapped in fossil \nfuel muck, the United States had still been making slow but steady \nprogress on climate policy. Then Trump was elected President, and he \ndecided to see if he could reverse all of this.\n  He announced that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris \nAgreement. He put the three stooges of fossil fuel--Scott Pruitt, Ryan \nZinke, and Rick Perry--in charge of climate policy. Trump completely \nforgot his and his family's own words from a full-page New York Times \nadvertisement in 2009, calling climate change ``irrefutable'' and \nportending ``catastrophic and irreversible consequences.'' That was \nDonald Trump and his family in 2009.\n  As bad as the news became coming out of Washington, we saw action \naround the country to give us some reason for optimism. The leadership \nvoid left by the Trump administration was filled by State and local \ngovernments, businesses, academic institutions, and faith organizations \nwhich pledged to honor the Paris Agreement. California and Washington \nState joined with Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico to \nannounce a plan to put a price on carbon that would reach virtually up \nand down the entire west coast of the Americas.\n  Over management opposition, BlackRock, the great investment firm, \nhelped force ExxonMobil to report its climate risk to its shareholders. \nMoody's announced it will start using climate risk in rating the bonds \nof coastal communities. Companies like Microsoft and Unilever adopted \nan internal carbon price to help them reduce the carbon intensity of \ntheir operations.\n  At heart, this is a battle of truth versus lies, and courts are a \ngood forum for the truth. California municipalities as well as New York \nCity have sued fossil fuel companies, under State law, over the huge \nadaptation costs they will have to bear from sea level rise and extreme \nweather. The State attorneys general in Massachusetts and New York are \npursuing a fraud investigation into what ExxonMobil has been covering \nup about its fossil fuels.\n  So there you have it. Over the last 6 years, we are ever more aware \nof the accelerating pace of climate change and ever more aware of the \nterrible threat that rising seas, increased temperatures, and more \nfrequent extreme weather events pose. It has become harder and harder \nfor the fossil fuel industry and the web of front groups and Trump \nadministration officials who do its bidding to claim there is nothing \nto see here, folks, that it is all a hoax, and to move along.\n  Yet, despite all of the information and all of the evidence, this \ngreat institution--the U.S. Senate--continues to sit silent, paralyzed \nby the threats of retribution that come from the fossil fuel lobby. \nWhen this started, I had hoped we would never get to 100--let alone \n199--of these speeches. We ought to have solved this years ago. It is a \ndisgrace that we haven't, and it is a disgrace as to why we haven't. If \nwe remain as ineffective as we have been during the last 6 years, we \nwill have failed ourselves and all future generations.\n  America deserves better than this. A city on a hill, with the eyes of \nthe\n\n\nworld upon it, can ill afford to ignore such a problem--worse still \nwhen the reason is one all-powerful industry that demands obedience. \nAmerica deserves better. The countries and people around the world who \nrely on and look to American leadership deserve better. At long last, \nit is time for us to wake up here and meet our responsibilities.\n\n\n                        Nuclear Innovation Bill\n\n  Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee has come to the floor. While she is here, may I \nthank her for her work in clearing the nuclear innovation bill that \nSenator Crapo and I passed into law this afternoon by unanimous \nconsent. The chairman's work, along with the ranking member's, in \nclearing that bill was essential to getting it passed, and she was a \ncosponsor and a critical force in getting it done. I am grateful to \nher.\n  I yield the floor."], "Mr. BARRASSO": ["2018-03-07", "  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, over the next couple of weeks, Congress \nis going to need to finalize government appropriations for the \nremainder of this year. Among the things that some people are talking \nabout is including money for a couple of ObamaCare programs. One of \nthem is money for the so-called cost-sharing reduction payments. \nFunding for these payments was never appropriated by Congress. The \nObama administration paid the insurance companies anyway. President \nTrump stopped these illegal payments last October. Now, some people in \nCongress are talking about funding them again.\n  We all know that ObamaCare has been a disaster for millions and \nmillions of families all across the country. We know that for the \npeople who live in States that use the Federal healthcare.gov exchange, \naverage premiums have doubled since the law took effect. Certainly \nWyoming is one of those States that experienced it; I heard about it in \nClark County just last week. We know it. We hear about it in letters \nfrom the people who write to us. No matter where they are from in the \nState of Wyoming, we continue to hear about the costs going up. I am \nsure there is a similar situation in the State of Arkansas, the \nPresiding Officer's State, as well.\n  According to Gallup, the number of uninsured people actually \nincreased last year by 3 million. Many people are finding that they \njust can't afford to have ObamaCare insurance. It is especially hard \nfor hard-working families who don't qualify for subsidies under the \nhealthcare law. So we know there is a problem, and we know we have to \ndo something to help people who are struggling in ObamaCare markets.\n  If people are going to discuss using this government spending law to \nspend more money on the collapsing ObamaCare markets, there are other \nthings we should be discussing as well. We should discuss finding a \nreal solution to rising healthcare costs--one that doesn't just \ncontinue the unworkable, unaffordable, and, frankly, unfair system that \nObamaCare created. We should discuss actually giving people more \nfreedom and more flexibility to choose a healthcare plan that is right \nfor them.\n  I am introducing a bill today to do just that. My legislation will \nbuild on a step that President Trump and the Trump administration took \nlast month. The administration reversed a last-minute Obama-era policy \nthat had all but killed short-term health plans. These are less \nexpensive health plans that are free from the expensive and intrusive \nand burdensome regulations that ObamaCare placed on other insurers, so \nthey are a much more affordable option for many Americans who have been \npriced out of ObamaCare.\n  President Trump is on the right path with this new rule. It is \nabsolutely the right decision. He is giving people back an option so \nthey can decide for themselves if it is a right choice for them. I \nthink we should go a step further, and that is why I am introducing \nthis legislation. We should go a step further in the omnibus spending \nbill. We should make this more affordable choice permanent. Making it \npermanent protects people. It protects people so a future \nadministration doesn't do what President Obama did and try to wipe out \nchoices for Americans.\n\n  This legislation I am introducing today gives people a choice to have \nthese plans for not just 90 days--which was allowed at the end of the \nObama administration--but for a full 364 days. So it is up to a year.\n  It also makes sure people can then renew these plans, if they want \nto, so it can become their permanent insurance, free from the mandates \nof the Obama healthcare law. It protects them from being dropped if \nthey are sick. Remember, that was one of the biggest promises of \nObamaCare that was broken. President Obama said: If you like your plan, \nyou can keep your plan. Almost immediately, people found out it wasn't \ntrue at all. In fact, it was called by some of the press the ``Lie of \nthe Year.''\n  In 2013 alone, there were 4.7 million Americans who got letters from \ntheir insurance companies telling them that their insurance plan had \nbeen canceled. Under my proposal, people with these short-term plans \nwouldn't have to worry about getting a cancellation letter. They would \nbe protected from their insurance company, and they would be protected \nfrom Washington, DC.\n  States are much better suited than Washington to regulate their \ninsurance markets in ways that work best for the citizens of their \nState. These simple changes in my legislation will help give people \nback--help give to them--the freedom ObamaCare took away. That is what \nwe are looking at, the need for freedom for the American people. We can \nessentially give people an escape hatch to get out of the ObamaCare \nplan entirely. We can give them the freedom to choose the coverage that \nworks for them and works best for their families.\n  That is the right way to bring down healthcare costs for Americans: \nGive them options, give them choices, give them freedom, not make them \nbuy a one-size-fits-all government plan.\n  People living in more than half of America's counties have only one \nchoice of insurance in the ObamaCare exchange--only one--half of the \ncounties in the country. It is not a choice. They don't have options. \nIt is a monopoly.\n  The left-leaning Urban Institute estimates that 4.2 million Americans \nwould enroll in short-term plans next year if we just let them keep \ntheir plan as long as a year. That is the kind of pent-up demand that \nis out there for these more affordable, more flexible plans with much \nmore freedom.\n  Just the one change could make a difference in the lives of 4 million \nAmericans. My legislation does just that, and it has other benefits as \nwell.\n  I think it would be an attractive option for many more Americans, but \na lot of Democrats in Washington don't want to talk about options. No. \nThey know ObamaCare markets are collapsing; they don't seem to care. \nThey know costs are soaring out of control; it doesn't seem to concern \nas many as it should. They know middle-class families are being \nsqueezed the hardest by these rising ObamaCare premiums. Their answer? \nWe have heard it. We have heard it on the floor of the Senate: Try to \npush everyone--everyone in America, want it or not, everyone in \nAmerica--into a single, government-run insurance plan that looks a lot \nlike Medicaid. That is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing \nand what I am proposing today.\n  What the Democrats are proposing is more of the same failed idea that \ncaused Americans so many problems under ObamaCare: government control.\n  If there is going to be talk of propping up the ObamaCare markets \nduring the omnibus spending bill, then we should also be talking about \nhelping people get out of the ObamaCare markets. Give them the freedom, \ngive them the escape hatch.\n  We should protect people who want health insurance but who don't want \nObamaCare health insurance. They know what works best for them and \ntheir families, and we should trust the American people to know what is \nbest for them and their families. We should give people the freedom and \nthe flexibility to make those decisions for themselves, and we should \ngive them more opportunities to escape from the disastrous, \ndestructive, and extremely expensive ObamaCare markets."], "The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner)": ["2018-03-07", "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Massachusetts."], "Ms. WARREN": ["2018-03-08", "  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, 10 years ago, millions of American \nfamilies were on the verge of devastation. The failure of Bear Stearns \nin March of 2008 was the first major signal of a coming financial \ncrisis that would cost 9 million people their jobs and millions more \npeople their homes or their savings. Lives and plans and dreams would \nbe crushed--and even after the economy began to recover its footing, \nmillions of American families would have to spend years just to get \nback to where they started before 2008. A lot of those families have \ngiven up the dream of home ownership forever, and many are still \nstruggling today.\n  But in the next few days, with broad support among Republicans and \nfar too much support among Democrats, the Senate is on the verge of \npassing a bill that puts American families in danger of that same \ndevastation all over again.\n  Over the last few days, I have talked about what this bill will do. I \nhave explained how it strips consumer protections for American families \nwho are trying to buy a home, particularly in low-income communities \nand communities of color. I have talked about how this bill will peel \naway vital safeguards we put on large banks after the financial crisis \nto make sure they can't crash the economy all over again.\n  Now, as the bill is on the verge of passing the Senate, I want to \nstop and just ask a basic question: Why? Who exactly is asking us to do \nthis?\n  Our constituents hate it. A recent poll showed that an overwhelming \nmajority of Americans oppose this bill. So why is it that the only \nthing Washington can agree to do on a bipartisan basis in this Congress \nis to help out giant banks?\n  I will tell you why. Washington's amnesia is legendary. We go through \nthe same cycle like clockwork. When the economy is looking good, \nlobbyists flood Congress and tell politicians it is perfectly safe to \nroll back the rules on the big banks. It is always the same set of \narguments: America needs more lending for more economic growth. Our \ncountry is losing ground to its competitors. Banks have learned their \nlesson and don't need rules to behave responsibly. And here is the \nkicker question: What could possibly go wrong? Every time, it works.\n  It works even though the lessons of history are clear. Strong \nfinancial rules help create a strong economy that works for everyone, \nand when we weaken the rules, it sets the stage for another financial \ncrisis--a crisis that, every time, hits America's working families the \nhardest.\n  Let's go back to the beginning of the 20th century. A lot of our \nfinancial regulations in the United States come from the Great \nDepression. Before then, Washington ignored the booms and busts that \nrocked the country every few years. But after the unemployment rate \ntopped 20 percent in the 1930s and the U.S. economy shrunk by about 30 \npercent, Washington--this Congress--finally got its act together to \npass some laws.\n  Here is what they did. First, they looked at all of the places where \npeople put their money--banks, home, markets--and then they built \nregulators for all of those different kinds of investments. Congress \ndid something really smart. It put a law in place called the Glass-\nSteagall Act. It broke up the biggest banks, and it separated the banks \nthat take deposits and make mortgages from high-risk institutions like \ninvestment banks.\n  This worked reasonably well for about half a century. There wasn't a \nsingle major financial crisis. But then, starting in the late 1970s and \nearly 1980s, bankers, looking for higher profits and bigger paychecks, \nset their sights on government rules. They wanted less regulation and \nmore freedom to trick their customers, to trap their customers, and to \ncheat their customers.\n  It started in the savings and loan industry. These institutions, \nwhich specialized in home mortgages, started to become insolvent \nbecause of the rising inflation and flaws in their business model. So \nthe bank lobbyists had a solution: Deregulate them. They said: Instead \nof just safe mortgages, why don't we let these institutions put out \nsome riskier stuff in hopes that some of these gambles will pay off \nbig. The Reagan administration agreed, but the plan failed. Over the \nnext decade, taxpayers spent $132 billion to bail out these \ninstitutions. That was in the 1980s.\n  But why stop there? Deregulating the thrifts, as disastrous as it \nwas, was just small ball. Thrifts were allowed to gamble only with a \nchunk of their own money. The lobbyists wanted to tear down all of the \nbarriers, throwing savings accounts and risky, complicated securities \ninto one big institution and then letting that bank gamble with all of \nit.\n  They dreamt of a Wall Street where banks could take the money in \ngrandma's checking account and use it to gamble in the markets. They \nwanted to tear down the wall Glass-Steagall had created between boring \nbanking and high-risk trading.\n  In 1999, the conditions were perfect to rip up the rules. Why? The \neconomy was cruising. Unemployment was down to 4.2 percent. The markets \nwere on fire. The Dow, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ smashed every record \nin their paths. In fact, the NASDAQ grew at 85.6 percent in 1999, the \nbiggest annual jump for a major index in U.S. history. One respected \nfinance professor gushed:\n\n       It's amazing. Every year we say it can't be another year of \n     20 percent-plus (gain)--and then every year it's a 20 \n     percent-plus gain.\n\n  It was the prime time for the bank lobbyists to strike. They swarmed \nCapitol Hill pushing, pulling, cajoling, running from the House to the \nSenate and back again, and most of this was happening behind closed \ndoors. But on a clear, cold day in February of 1999, eight bankers and \ntwo lobbyists testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee, and \nthe knives were out for Glass-Steagall. The euphemism people used then \nwas ``modernization.'' When lobbyists start talking about modernization \nand clarification, it is time to buy a parachute.\n\n  Let me tell you about KeyCorp, one of the banks that would be taken \noff the watch list in the bill we are going to be voting on in the \ncoming days. Back in 1999, the CEO of that company testified that the \n``financial law modernization that strengthens our financial \ninstitutions in and of itself will enhance safety and soundness.'' \nThink about what that means. Behind the buzzwords, that CEO was making \nthe amazing claim that if banks were just allowed to take more risks \nand make more short-term profits, it would actually make the financial \nsystem safer. In other words, if we just deregulate the banks, they \nwill become safer.\n  He wasn't the only one to make a claim like that. The vice chairman \nof JPMorgan said: ``There is a consensus shared by most financial firms \nand their customers, as well as policymakers, that these rules restrict \ncompetition, reduce consumer choice, and are not necessary to protect \nconsumers or insured financial institutions.'' In other words, rules \nare the problem--if banks could just do whatever they wanted, \neverything would be great.\n  Guess what. The pitch worked. Nine months later, in late 1999, a bill \nto repeal key parts of Glass-Steagall and roll back other financial \nrules passed both Houses of Congress overwhelmingly. Ninety Senators \nvoted yes. Senator after Senator, including quite a few who are still \nhere today, came to the Senate floor and praised the bill for \nmodernizing our financial rules and getting rid of unnecessary and \noutdated requirements.\n  But not everyone was fooled. Some Senators knew better. Senator Paul \nWellstone from Minnesota warned that Congress ``seem[s] determined to \nunlearn the lessons from our past mistakes . . . [and] is about to \nrepeal [Glass-Steagall] without putting any comparable safeguard in its \nplace.''\n  Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota was especially prescient. He \nsaid:\n\n       I think we will look back in 10 years' time and say we \n     should not have done this but we did because we forgot the \n     lessons of the past, and that that which is true in the \n     1930's is true in 2010. . . . We now have decided in the name \n     of modernization to forget the lessons of the past, of safety \n     and of soundness.\n\n  But Congress ignored their warnings. For the bargain price of $300 \nmillion in lobbyist bills, the big banks saw their wildest dreams come \ntrue. With the repeal of Glass-Steagall, too-big-to-fail megabanks were \nborn. Citibank became Citigroup. J.P. Morgan became\n\n\nJPMorgan Chase. The banks got bigger and bigger and bigger.\n  But the lobbyists weren't done yet. Over the next decade, they tried \nover and over to expand the loopholes that they had punched until both \nthe regulators and the regulations gave way. By the middle of the \ndecade, the conditions were right. Markets broke records. The \nunemployment rate was below 5 percent. It was time for the lobbyists to \ngo at it again. Hand-tailored suits and Gucci loafers swarmed Capitol \nHill. Meetings were scheduled. So were fundraisers. Their efforts again \noccasionally spilled out into the public hearing rooms.\n  This pitch might sound familiar. In 2006, the head of risk at \nCitigroup, on behalf of the Financial Services Roundtable, told the \nHouse Financial Services Committee: ``The U.S. needs to modernize its \ncapital regulations, and there are a variety of new approaches that all \nrepresent a significant improvement over the current system.'' In other \nwords, the regulations are outdated.\n  Steve Bartlett, a former Congressman who was a lobbyist for the 50 \nbiggest banks, told the Senate Banking Committee in 2005: ``Outdated \nlaws and regulations impose significant, and unnecessary, burdens on \nfinancial services firms, and these burdens not only make our firms \nless efficient, but also increase the cost of financial products and \nservices to consumers.'' In other words, set the banks free, and let \nthem do whatever they want. What could possibly go wrong?\n  In 2005, the head of the American Bankers Association told the \ncommittee: ``The cost of unnecessary paperwork and red tape is a \nserious long-term problem that will continue to erode the ability of \nbanks to serve our customers and support the economic growth of our \ncommunities.'' In other words, in the end, these rules hurt consumers. \nLet the banks do whatever they want to consumers.\n  Then, just as the lobbyists were gaining momentum, the economy they \ncreated crashed. It was 2008, and millions of families lost their \nhomes, millions lost their savings, and millions lost their jobs. But \nthe lobbyists didn't lose their jobs. They peddled myths about the \neconomy and the financial system, and they kept right on working for \nthe big banks. All during the efforts to pass financial regulations to \nget our economy out of the ditch, the bank lobbyists were there. They \npulled in more than $1 million a day lobbying against financial reform.\n  When the American people started to demand action in the wake of the \n2008 crash, the reforms passed anyway. But the lobbyists didn't give \nup. They didn't go away. Before the ink was dry on Dodd-Frank, they \njumped right back in and started lobbying to roll back the new rules.\n  So here we are again. It took years, but the economy is humming \nagain. In 2016, the unemployment rate dipped below 5 percent for the \nfirst time since before the 2008 crisis. In 2017, the Dow jumped 25 \npercent, and the NASDAQ grew by 28 percent. And you know what that \nmeans--it means the bank lobbyists have once again taken center stage, \ninsisting that it is safe to deregulate their clients again, all in the \nname of economic growth and empowering consumers. It is the same \nargument as before.\n  Last spring, bank lobbyist Greg Baer said:\n\n       After nearly a decade of fundamental and continuing changes \n     to financial regulation, now is an opportune time to review \n     the efficacy of our current bank regulatory framework. My \n     testimony will focus on reforms that could directly and \n     immediately enhance economic growth.\n\n  In other words, turn the big banks loose, and let's see what they can \ndo.\n  Harris Simmons, the CEO of Zions Bank, which will be kicked off the \nwatch list under the bill that is now under consideration, recently \ntestified that ``the uncertainty surrounding [Dodd-Frank reforms] can \ncause banks to withdraw or limit certain kinds of lending.'' To put it \nanother way: Get out of the way and let the big banks cheat their \ncustomers again. It is good for bank profits.\n  Here we go again. I get it. Our financial regulations need work. \nThere are things we could do to reduce the load on community banks, and \nthere are still big dangers to consumers that we should take up. But \nthis bill isn't about the unfinished business of the last financial \ncrisis; this bill is about laying the groundwork for the next financial \ncrisis.\n  I will make a prediction. This bill will pass, and if the banks get \ntheir way, in the next 10 years or so, there will be another financial \ncrisis. Of course, when the crash comes, the big banks will throw up \ntheir hands and say that it is not their fault, that nobody could have \nseen it coming. Then they will run to Congress and beg for bailout \nmoney, and--let's be blunt--they will probably get it. But just like in \n2008, there will be no bailout for working families. Jobs will be lost, \nand lives will be destroyed. The American people, not the banks, will \nonce again bear the burden.\n  Then, caught in a fog of amnesia, the lobbyists and regulators and \nelected officials in Washington will scratch their heads and wonder how \nin the world it could have possibly happened again. But the American \npeople won't be confused about it at all. They never are. They are much \nsmarter than the people around here give them credit for. They won't \nwonder why it happened; they will know why it happened. They will know \nit was because the people in Washington ignored working people in order \nto do the bidding of the guys in fancy suits and the handmade shoes who \nwrite the fat campaign checks. Look at the numbers. Seventy-eight \npercent of Americans think big banks have too much control over Members \nof Congress. That includes 68 percent of people who voted for Donald \nTrump. Everyone knows that Congress sold them out last time, and \neveryone expects it to happen again this time.\n  As we prepare to vote on this bill, I ask my colleagues one more \ntime, do the job you were sent here to do. Stand up for the people who \nsent us here. Stop doing the bidding of big bank lobbyists, and start \nworking on the things that can make a difference in the lives of \nworking people around this country. The American people need it.

But the previous administration's interpretation of the act's \nreporting requirements has become overly burdensome for smaller \nfinancial institutions.\n  Community banks and credit unions are weighed down with the same \ncompliance burdens as larger institutions, without the advantages of \nmassive compliance departments. The Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau's rulemaking of October 2015 on the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act \nwould require financial institutions to report\n\n\n33 new data fields for each borrower, more than double the statutory \nrequirement laid out by Congress on top of an already detailed HMDA \ndata collection requirement.\n  Fortunately, Mr. Emmer's bill, the Home Mortgage Disclosure \nAdjustment Act, would remove some of the compliance burdens placed on \nour Nation's smallest financial institutions by exempting depository \ninstitutions that have originated fewer than 500 closed-end mortgage \nloans and fewer than 500 open-end lines of credit from disclosure \nrequirements and maintenance of mortgage loan records under the 2015 \nHMDA rule.\n  The CFPB's October 2015 rulemaking requires financial institutions to \nreport on over 100 total data points for any loan application, \nregardless of whether the institution agrees to make the loan or not.\n  To put that in perspective, the time and resources required by a \ncommunity financial institution to fill out all 100 of these data \npoints for each application could be the difference between being able \nto make one more loan in a community or not. And in small communities \nacross America, small communities like I represent, every single loan \ncounts.\n\n  With Mr. Emmer's legislation, the community financial institutions \nleast able to absorb compliance burdens would be able to turn their \nattention and resources back to providing loans for hardworking \nfamilies, rather than meeting overly burdensome regulatory \nrequirements.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to applaud Mr. Emmer for introducing this \nlegislation and encourage my colleagues to be able to support this \nmeasure."], "Mr. KELLY of Mississippi": ["2018-03-09", "  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi.

Mr. Speaker, tonight I join to talk and to thank the \nleadership of the Republican Party, who made a firm decision during the \nlast elections that our party needed to stand for not only making \nAmerica great again, but every single American who needed an \nopportunity to join in that endeavor.\n  Tonight, I stand in this beautiful time that we discuss the tax bill \nthat Republicans passed last year and talk about the effects of it and \nhow much it has helped in America.\n  I think a story needs to be told about what the goal of the tax bill \nwas. Why did Republicans work so hard to move these ideas forward?\n  The bottom line to it is Americans watched as the Democratic Party \nand President Obama not only had their control of the country, but \neconomically, as the policies of the Democratic Party became more \napparent to people, Americans and the world watched as America dwindled \nin economic activity and economic growth.\n  This took place because of the policies that the President, President \nObama at the time, brought forth and Congress passed: trillion-dollar \nspending plans, trillion-dollar increases in the budget, and talk of \nraising taxes another trillion dollars.\n  What happened is, for some 8 years, there was GDP growth of about 1.2 \npercent. Mr. Speaker, that means, very plainly, that it would take \nabout 70 years to double the size of our economy, which means that \ncommunities and States and companies and individuals lag behind as they \nwould watch other cities and other countries and other people around \nthe globe not only have economic activity, but opportunities that came \nto their doorsteps. IPOs, or initial public offerings, and all the \nacronyms that go with economic growth and development went overseas; \nthey went other places.\n  So Republicans began this discussion with the American people going \ninto 2010 that said: We need to be careful about government spending, \nbut, on the same side, what we need to do is to grow our economy. That \nis exactly the discussion that took place during the last Presidential \nelection.\n  So as soon as the election was over, Republicans began the process of \nnot only making America great again, but doing it by empowering every \nsingle State and every single American to be a part of this growth. \nEssentially, there was a look at some $12 trillion worth of economic \ntax components.\n  Kevin Brady, who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, \nfrom Houston, Texas--actually, Spring, Texas--was in charge, as the \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee, of looking at how we were \ngoing to move our economy forward. I call that pop.\n  How we were going to take economic activity and, instead of perhaps \nhelping an individual or a company or necessarily one particular part \nof the economy, we wanted where it would go and add pop or \ngenerationally develop more economic activity than just for a singular \nentity.\n\n\n  And Kevin Brady, as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, \nlooked at some $5.6 trillion out of this $12 trillion and said: We need \nto take that and make that the engine of the economy.\n  So a decision was made to move that directly to the free enterprise \nsystem. Mr. Speaker, it is the free enterprise system that stands as \nthe greatest activity for freedom in the world, an activity that not \nonly brings opportunity and investment and entrepreneurship, but more \nthan that, wealth. It has brought wealth to the United States of \nAmerica, a free enterprise system that is there to produce for anyone \nthat chooses to be participatory in that environment--an opportunity to \nbegin by investing your own money, by hard work where you show up at \nwork, and having customers or consumers that go and generate economic \nactivity, and that is what America has been, and that is what we were \nslowing down.\n  The engine of that economy was slowed down because our predecessors, \nnot only in the Presidency but also our friends who are Democrats, \nbelieved that they would engage the free enterprise system in such a \nway that did not allow it to grow, did not allow it to expand, and did \nnot allow itself to build.\n  So what Kevin Brady did, as chairman of the Ways and Means, was \npropose a tax bill that would take $5.6 trillion worth of tax \ncomponents and move it directly to the free enterprise system. By \nmoving it to the free enterprise system, we reduced taxes. We reduced \ntaxes from the 37 percent range for corporate down to 21 percent.\n  What does that do? Well, that takes America, an American business as \nseen by the world, from 24th in the world to number one. So instead of \nus being what might be on a list of 24th place of easy-to-do business, \nthat was generating not only goods and services, but was the ease of \ndoing business with, that people wanted to be a part of, that has taken \nus to first in the world.\n  That means that America will begin building back not only jobs and \njob creation, but it will build back with the intellectual capacity to \nbuild the newest, finest ideas and products that the world needs for \ntomorrow because America will be a place that is not only easy to do \nbusiness but is less priced, and because we can be less priced, we can \nbecome the products of choice all around the world.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I want to say: This is working. This is working to \ntake America not only where they are in first place, but it means \nAmericans and American companies can be in the same position.\n  As a Member of Congress from Dallas, Texas, I have an opportunity to \nsee firsthand not only how this impacts people and companies but how it \nimpacts the workers. And it wasn't but 2 weeks ago when I was at what \nwas called the National Write Your Congressman, which is headquartered \nin Dallas, Texas. Randy Ford is their President; and Randy gave me good \nnews. He said that of the small businesses that they had talked to, \nthat they believed that 74 percent of small-business owners expected \nrevenues to be higher in 2018, and even higher the next year, which \nmeant that they felt positive about not only economic growth but, more \nimportantly, their companies.\n  I also visited Texas Moving Company, which is a family owned business \nof some 40 years old that is in Richardson, Texas, and they told me, \npoint-blank, that as a result of us making sure that we would reduce \nthe cost of doing business by reducing taxes, that they had increased \ntheir driver's pay by over $2,400.\n  That means that it does come directly to the employees that are able \nto have not only more take-home pay, but they are able to know that \nthey can fall into more easily knowing that they may take a part-time \njob to a full-time job, a full-time job to a career, and a career as an \nopportunity to make sure that they better the lives of not only their \nfamily but their children also in their community.\n  And this is why Texas Moving Company made a decision then, as they \nsaw this money that they would have; they made a determination that \nthey would increase their employees by $2,400, but they also increased \ntheir health insurance reimbursement to where they now pay $3,484 a \nyear to help their employees to pay more of their healthcare costs \nbecause they can do that on a pretax basis.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is all these things that the Republican majority has \ndone. When others said it would simply be crumbs or unimportant, we \nsaid we are going to focus on making America great again; and when you \ndo that, you will find that you not only make America great, but you \nmake Americans and their families greater also.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is why we, as Texans, stand up not only as proud \nMembers of the Congress, but also as proud Americans who say: We want \nto make\n\n\nsure that everybody, no matter where they live in the United States, \nthat they would be a part of making their city, their State, their \ncompany, and their family even stronger.\n  I appreciate Mr. Mitchell allowing me to be here tonight. It is my \nhope that the discussion that we have with the American people and the \nChair, Mr. Speaker, that you will recognize that if we are going to do \nthis, it will mean that we are going to have to understand it is not up \nto government to make this work; it is up to the American people.

Mr. Speaker, tonight I will have the \nprivilege of hearing the State of the Union Address that I have been \nwaiting to hear since I first came to Congress 7 years ago.\n  Tonight our entire country will hear a confident message of \nundeniable good news for all Americans--not based on fantasy and hope, \nbut on facts and undeniable success.\n  Tonight the President of the United States will come to the people's \nHouse and speak to a nation that is far better off today than we were \njust 1 year ago in every measurable way.\n  Now, this success did not come by accident. Over the past year, by \nworking with a unified Congress, President Trump was able to begin \nimplementing his agenda to Make America Great Again.\n  Let's revisit what he has done when it comes to accomplishments.\n  The signing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act marked the first time our \nTax Code was updated in over 31 years. It lowered tax rates for all \ntaxpayers across the board, and it cut the corporate tax rate down from \n35 percent to 21 percent which allows us to compete globally. It \npermanently repealed ObamaCare's individual mandate. It opened up ANWR \nfor drilling and brand new energy exploration.\n  When it comes to deregulation, he signed 15 CRA bills into law in \nless than a year, imposed a groundbreaking rule on the Federal \nbureaucracy to kill two regulations for every new regulation written, \nand has rolled back more job-killing red tape than every President \nbefore him combined.\n  When it comes to the courts, by appointing conservatives like Neil \nGorsuch to the Supreme Court and a historic number to the appellate \ncourts, he is restoring constitutionalism and common sense to our \njudiciary system. These appointments will reverberate for generations \nto come.\n  Now, when it comes to the outcomes, the entire stock market is at an \nall-time high. Contrary to what some people will speak, this affects \nthe pensions of all Americans. Female unemployment is at its lowest \nlevel since 2001. Black and Hispanic unemployment are at their lowest \nlevels ever. For 13 different States, overall unemployment is at its \nlowest rate since we first began recording it.\n  New manufacturing orders are increasing at their fastest pace in 14 \nyears. Quarterly GDP is exceeding expectations and is on track for a 3 \npercent annual growth rate for the first time in 13 years. Consumer \nconfidence is at its highest level since 2000. Job market confidence is \nat its highest level ever, and because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \nalone, more than 3 million American workers--and counting--are \nreceiving $1,000 bonuses, or more, wage increases, and/or benefit \nincreases. Now, in my own city that I live in, NexTier Bank gave over \n250 of its associates a $1,000 bonus. Those are hardly crumbs when it \ncomes to hardworking American taxpayers.\n  Abroad, the Islamic State--once thought to be unstoppable--is now \nshattered. Military morale, recently at rock bottom, is now soaring. \nOur troops are currently receiving their largest pay raise in 8 years.\n  When it comes to liberty and conscience issues, we ended the war on \nreligious liberty. We tore up the so-called HHS contraceptive mandate; \nno more nuns fighting for their survival in the Supreme Court; and we \nreinstated the Mexico City policy the first weekend in office.\n  When it comes to energy, we ended the war on coal, we stopped the \nEPA's so-called Clean Power Plan, we approved both the Keystone XL and \nDakota pipelines, and we have plans in place to dramatically expand \noffshore drilling.\n\n\n  When it comes to American leadership, we pulled out of the Paris \nclimate accord, we ended the Cuba appeasement, we condemned and \ndecertified the Iran deal, and Guantanamo Bay is still open with no \nthreat of closing.\n  By changing the rules of engagement, trusting our generals, and \nunleashing our military might, he has overseen the total destruction of \nthe ISIS caliphate. The entire world is safer because of American \nleadership. Through his words and deeds--most recently with Jerusalem--\nthe world sees America leading with moral clarity and confidence again.\n  Mr. Speaker, tonight I will have the privilege of hearing the State \nof the Union that I have been waiting to hear for 7 years. Tonight we \nwill look at an economy and a State of the Union that is as strong as \nPittsburgh steel.\n  Our economy is roaring, and America's optimism is soaring. Our \ncitizens are becoming more prosperous. Our law enforcement is becoming \nempowered and not undermined. Our military is growing stronger by the \nday. Our international credibility is being restored. Our friends, once \nagain, trust us; and our enemies, once again, fear us.

The stakes are too high to let this \nnominee slide by without full consideration of what it would mean for \nDirector Pompeo to be our Nation's top diplomat--the person whose every \nword and action broadcasts America's values to the rest of the world.\n  Some of my opposition concerns Director Pompeo's harsh views on \nmatters of war and peace, and his blatantly false accusations regarding \nmembers of the Muslim community. Some of my opposition surrounds my \ndeep concern about Director Pompeo's ability to stand strong against \nPresident Trump's erratic and uninformed foreign policy positions.\n  But what I wanted to take a few minutes this afternoon to do is to \nexpress my serious concern about what Director Pompeo's ideological, \nextreme positions on women's rights and reproductive freedom would mean \nfor women across the world.\n  Our Nation has an important role to uphold as a global champion of \nwomen's rights. We need a Secretary of State who will be a strong \nadvocate and continue our legacy of leadership in fighting for women's \nhealth and reproductive freedom and the rights of women and girls \naround the world. Instead, I am afraid Director Pompeo would undo much \nof that legacy and undermine much of the global progress we have made.\n  An advocate for women doesn't repeatedly support the global gag rule, \nwhich keeps funding from clinics and programs that provide women \nimportant medical care. Director Pompeo did.\n  An advocate for women doesn't vote to defund the United Nations \nPopulation Fund, which provides family planning services for women \naround the world who live in poverty. Director Pompeo did.\n  When it comes to fighting for the survivors of rape and against those \nwho would use rape as a tool of war, it is clear we should stand by \nsurvivors, fight for them, and work to make sure they have access to \nthe medical care they need. However, Director Pompeo has said he would \nprevent women who have been raped from access to abortions. That is an \nunacceptably cruel response to women and war survivors, and it is one \nof the many clear indicators that Director Pompeo is an unacceptable \nchoice to serve as Secretary of State.\n  The Secretary of State is always a critically important position, but \nit takes on even more important meaning in 2018. The President not only \nneeds good counsel in navigating our complex global relationships, but \nhe also desperately needs someone who can tell him when he is wrong and \nwho can stand up to him and be a check on this President's worse \nimpulses.\n  Throughout his nomination process, Director Pompeo failed to convince \nme that he is that person.

Mr. President, I filed an amendment yesterday that, I \nhope, will be included in this banking bill that the Senate is \nconsidering today and tomorrow.\n  My amendment was inspired by a bill I introduced last July, which is \na simple bill, bipartisan, and should be noncontroversial. Here is what \nthe amendment would do: It would exempt trust-preferred securities from \na bank's capital requirements.\n  Now, you ask: What is a trust-preferred security?\n  It is an investment vehicle that looks a little bit like equity and, \nat the same time, looks a little bit like debt.\n  How did these come about?\n  Actually, the FDIC asked many banks to invest in such securities in \nprevious decades. A company creates trust-preferred securities by \ncreating a trust, issuing debt to it, and then having it issue \npreferred stock to investors--trust, debt, and preferred stock to \ninvestors. The FDIC used to like trust-preferred securities. It \nconsidered them sound investments before 2010. May I repeat: The FDIC \nasked many banks to invest in these securities. However, through its \ninterpretation of the Basel III regulations, the FDIC is now counting \nthese securities against the banks' capital holdings.\n  Who is affected by this?\n  It happens to be 20 small banks in the heartland of America.\n  My amendment would exempt these banks from having to consider trust-\npreferred securities as part of their capital requirements; therefore, \nit would promote growth in rural communities around the country as well \nas provide regulatory relief for our small banks.\n  That is really what this bill is about. The Dodd-Frank legislation \ntook a broad-brush approach and punished many medium and small banks \nwhen they had nothing to do with the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. \nDodd-Frank has done harm to Main Street. My amendment would alleviate \nsome of that harm. If we want to help banks grow the economy, we need \nto be mindful of the ways in which Dodd-Frank's excessive regulations \nare hurting small banks. This goes right in hand with the major thrust \nof this overwhelmingly bipartisan bill on which we are about to proceed \ntoday or tomorrow.\n  These 20 small banks nationwide inject needed capital and access to \ncredit in our communities--capital and credit to launch new local \nbusinesses or create jobs. When these small banks struggle, communities \nstruggle. For one to comply with the one-size-fits-all Dodd-Frank \nregulations demands resources that some of our community banks do not \nhave. Here I am arguing for my amendment and for the entire bill. \nUnlike big banks, these small banks in rural communities might be \nforced to close because of the demands that are too high or they might \nhave to pass along extra costs to consumers. Neither option helps our \nlocal communities and the people who live there.\n  These 20 small rural banks were not in the least bit responsible for \nthe financial crisis. So my amendment, based on a bipartisan bill, \nrecognizes, along with the base bill, the fact that the small banks are \nnot part of the problem and never were part of the problem.

Mr. President, in the late 1980s, Congress debated and \nadopted amnesty legislation for 3 million people who were here \nillegally. It did so promising the American people that in exchange for \namnesty, the Federal Government would finally, finally, finally secure \nthe border. We all know what happened. That amnesty occurred, and the \nborder never got secured. At the time, there were 3 million people \nliving here illegally. Today, estimates are that there are in excess of \n12 million people living here illegally.\n  Five years ago, in 2013, this body again debated amnesty. The so-\ncalled Gang of 8 again failed to secure the border but once again made \nthe same promise of amnesty for millions here illegally in exchange for \nan ephemeral, never-to-come promise to secure the border. The Senate \nultimately passed the Gang of 8 bill. As it was being voted on, Senate \nDemocrats bragged on television that they believed they had north of 70 \nvotes--that now was the time, again, to pass amnesty.\n  Yet the American people rose up and said: Amnesty is not what we \nwant. It is inconsistent with the rule of law. We saw Senators at the \nlast minute jumping ship. At the end of the day, it passed this body by \n68 votes and then went nowhere in the House of Representatives.\n  So again, today, we are here having the same debate. I feel like Bill \nMurray\n\n\nin ``Groundhog Day,'' waking up and reliving the same day over and over \nand over, and the result is the same.\n  Listen, I don't know how these votes will occur this afternoon. It \nmay be that nothing gets 60 votes. That is possible. But it may also be \nthat the Senate embraces one of the various amnesty plans that is put \non the table. If that is the case, it will be every bit as big a \nmistake as the Gang of 8 was a mistake and as the amnesty in the 1980s \nwas a mistake. I must say that I find myself flabbergasted at where my \nown party is in this debate, because every proposal that has Republican \nsupport that has been submitted begins from a place markedly to the \nleft of that of President Obama.\n  President Obama, as we all know, issued DACA, which was otherwise \nknown as Executive amnesty. Executive amnesty was illegal and \nunconstitutional. The President has no authority to refuse to enforce \nthe law. Yet President Obama decreed that he would not enforce Federal \nimmigration laws, and that is exactly what he did.\n  At the time, virtually every Republican denounced Executive amnesty \nas unconstitutional, as lawless, as wrong. Yet today, far too many \nSenate Republicans are staking out a place well to the left of \nPresident Obama on DACA on numerous axes. No. 1, DACA itself covered \n690,000 people. Yet what is the proposal being considered by this body? \nUnder the mildest of the proposals, we are considering a path to \ncitizenship for 1.8 million people. Why on Earth would we more than \ndouble--nearly triple--the DACA population? If there are 690,000 people \nwho received illegal and unconstitutional Executive amnesty, then, it \nseems to me that, at the very most, the population we should consider \nis those 690,000.\n  The argument is made that they have relied on this promise, even \nthough the promise was illegal and even though it was unconstitutional. \nThe people who relied on this promise are the 690,000, not the 1.1 \nmillion who never even applied.\n  So I would ask why Republicans--and, indeed, why Democrats--are \nnearly tripling what President Obama did in DACA. But that is not the \nonly regard. DACA never included citizenship. Nothing in President \nObama's DACA allowed citizenship. Nothing in it allowed a path to \ncitizenship. DACA was a work permit, nothing more than a work permit--\nan illegal work permit, mind you--but it did not allow citizenship. Yet \ntoday far too many Republicans are eager to embrace the Democrats' \ndemands that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 million people here illegally should be \ngranted a path to citizenship. That is wrong. That is plain and simple \nwrong. It is unfair to the millions of working men and women. It is \nunfair to the steelworkers, the truckdrivers, and the mechanics. It is \nunfair to millions of American citizens, working men and women, who \nfaced stagnant wages under President Obama. It is unfair to millions of \nlegal immigrants whose wages are driven down by those here illegally. \nIt is inconsistent with the promises made by virtually every Republican \nin this body.\n  Every Republican who went out and campaigned against Executive \namnesty said: We will not have amnesty. Well, now is the time to \nchoose. If this body chooses to grant citizenship to 2, 3, 4 million \npeople here illegally, those promises will have been directly broken. \nThat is a mistake. It is wrong. Not only that, but the legislation this \nbody is preparing to consider not only would grant citizenship, but it \nwould make those here illegally eligible for Federal welfare--Federal \nwelfare benefits. Not only do people come here illegally, but it drives \nup the cost.\n  Every one of us has been asked by American citizens: Why are we \nspending vast sums of money providing welfare benefits? Why would we \nwant to do that to those here illegally?\n  We are a nation of immigrants. My father came as an immigrant in 1957 \nwith nothing--$100 in his underwear and not speaking English--but he \ncame legally. We should be embracing legal immigrants rather than \nexcusing and condoning illegal immigration.\n  I do not believe we should be granting citizenship to anyone here \nillegally, nor should we be providing Federal welfare benefits to \nanyone here illegally, nor should we be expanding the pool of DACA \nrecipients beyond that in the Obama program. Yet Republicans seem eager \nto do so. It is possible that our Democratic friends will save us from \nthis foolishness--that even though Republicans are proposing a \nprofoundly foolhardy immigration proposal, the Democrats will decide \nthey want even more. There is not enough amnesty that the Democrats \ncould take. If they do that, that will save the day for now. But if \nnot, if this body gets 60 votes for one of these amnesty proposals, \nthen it is incumbent on the House to stop it, much like with the Gang \nof 8.\n\n  In the Gang of 8, the Senate couldn't stop it. The Senate has always, \nunfortunately, been very liberal on immigration. It has been very \nwilling to make promises to the voters and promptly come down here and \nvote very differently from those promises. But the House of \nRepresentatives--the People's House--is designed to be responsive to \nthe people. So it is my hope that House conservatives, facing the \npeople and listening to the people, will recognize that we had an \nelection in 2014 in response to the Gang of 8. The American people \nsaid: We don't want the Gang of 8. They elected the largest House \nmajority of Republicans in 70 years. They elected 9 new Republicans in \nthe Senate and retired Harry Reid as majority leader. Yet, somehow, \nRepublicans in this body didn't hear the voters in 2014. We had an \nelection in 2016 that the media was ready to call for Hillary Clinton. \nYet, front and center in the 2016 election, was the American people \nsaying: We don't want amnesty.\n  My call to our colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, is listen \nto the people.\n  There are many things we can and should be doing. We should be \npassing Kate's Law. I authored and introduced Kate's Law in this body. \nKate's Law provides that for an aggravated felon who has been \nrepeatedly entering this country illegally and who has been deported \nrepeatedly, that that aggravated felon have a mandatory minimum prison \nsentence. Kate's Law is known for Kate Steinle, that beautiful woman in \nCalifornia murdered on a pier by an illegal alien deported over and \nover with multiple felony convictions. Had Kate's Law been on the \nbooks, I believe it is very likely that Kate Steinle would still be \nalive. That is the sort of commonsense legislation on which we ought to \nbe coming together and passing. Yet there is the old adage: Those who \nfail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\n  This body made a grievous mistake in passing the Gang of 8 bill. \nThankfully, the House saved us from our error. We may be on the verge \nof making the same grievous mistake. It is almost as if elections don't \npenetrate. We need to be listening to the voters.\n  I do not know a single Republican--not one in this body, not one in \nthe House of Representatives--who was elected on a promise: I will go \nto the left of Barack Obama on immigration.\n  If one of us campaigned promising that, knock yourself out. Vote for \nthis. But if you didn't say that Obama's Executive amnesty didn't go \nfar enough, that we need to double or triple the pool, that we need to \ngrant citizenship because Obama was too much of a conservative on \nimmigration--if you didn't say that--then the only vote consistent with \nwhat we told the voters is to vote no today. We can come together and \nfind commonsense solutions on immigration. We can secure the border. We \ncan triple the Border Patrol. We can end catch and release. We can \nimplement a strong E-verify. We can use strong tools and technology. We \ncan continue to embrace and celebrate legal immigrants, and we can do \nall of that while respecting the rule of law.\n  What I would urge my colleagues to do is very simple. Ask yourself \nwhat you told the voters before election, and let your conduct after \nelection day match what you told the voters.\n  As for the Democrats, the Democrats campaigned as the party of \namnesty. They are at least being true to their promises. They promised \namnesty. That is their priority. They are being true. But for \nRepublicans, we promised something different. We promised to stand with \nthe working men and women, the union members, the steelworkers, the men \nand women with calluses on their hands.\n  I urge every one of us to listen to the working men and women, to \nrespect the rule of law, and to vote against these misguided proposals.\n\n\n  I yield the floor."], "Ms. TSONGAS": ["2018-04-25", "  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I join Ranking Member Grijalva in opposing \nthis legislation and urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  For 45 years, the Endangered Species Act has served as one of our \nNation's bedrock environmental statutes. The bald eagle, the American \nalligator, and the gray whale are just a few examples of iconic species \nthat have recovered from the brink of extinction thanks to the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  Despite its widely recognized success and broad support across State \nand party lines, today, the House is seeking to pass yet another bill \nthat undermines this bedrock environmental law and causes irreparable \nharm to salmon and steelhead species, species that are already at great \nrisk of extinction, species that play an irreplaceable role in the \nPacific Northwest's ecosystem. Their presence benefits more than 130 \nother species, including the critically endangered Southern Resident \nkiller whales, whose existence depends upon healthy salmon runs.\n  This is not just about the Pacific Northwest. Any effort to undermine \nthe Endangered Species Act and, thereby, its protections for the \nspecies and landscapes that make our country uniquely American impacts \nus all.\n  Several Federal agencies and courts have determined that dam \noperations in the Columbia and Snake Rivers cause significant harm to \n13 species or populations of salmon and steelhead listed under the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  Instead of allowing science-based management practices that protect \nboth endangered species and the many users of these rivers, including \nhydropower generators, this legislation locks in a failing operation \nplan that has already been found in violation of the Endangered Species \nAct. Knowingly endangering the existence of salmon is in direct \nviolation of the law and betrays the long bipartisan tradition of the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  Instead of rolling back critical safeguards and recovery efforts, we \nshould reject this legislation and support a transparent stakeholder-\ndriven process that protects endangered species and the many fishermen, \nbusinesses, communities, and Tribes who depend on a sustainable \nColumbia River.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3144."], "Mr. COTTON": ["2018-02-15", "  Mr. COTTON.

Prior to \nthat, Lorie served for eight years as a Rockwall County Commissioner \nand, going further back, served Rockwall area communities for nine \nyears on the Rockwall ISD Board of Trustees (including two terms as \nboard president).\n  As Lorie neared the end of her second term as County Commissioner, \nshe announced that she was not going to seek re-election and planned to \nconclude her public service when her term expired at the end of 2014. \nHowever, as I was preparing to begin my first term in Congress, I asked \nLorie to consider foregoing her plans and instead continue serving the \npublic by becoming part of my original district office staff in January \n2015. Lorie graciously agreed to set aside her own plans, and to the \ngreater benefit of the three quarters of a million Texans in this \ndistrict, has selflessly served these past three years as an invaluable \nmember of my congressional staff.\n  Now, after a full 20 years of service to the public in Rockwall and \nsurrounding communities, Lorie is ready to enjoy the next chapter in \nher life. Together, we have accomplished much these past three years \nfor our communities and constituents. I will be forever grateful for \nher service in my office and to our constituents and communities, and \nfor the lives we have been able to touch and change along the way. I am \nparticularly grateful for her help in building and leading our process \nfor identifying and selecting deserving students to receive nominations \nto our nation's service academies. During the three years under her \nleadership, I am proud to say that we have been able to offer more than \n75 nominations to incredible young women and men across the 4th \nDistrict of Texas. As a result of Lorie's dedication to this mission, I \nknow that our country will be better served by the many outstanding \nfuture leaders who have accepted appointments to our nation's service \nacademies.\n  Again, I express my sincere gratitude to Lorie Grinnan and to her \nfamily for the sacrifices they have made over these past two decades to \nsupport her dedicated career of public service. Godspeed to Lorie \nGrinnan and her family as they look forward to the next chapter of \nGod's plan for her blessed life.\n"], "Mr. FRANKS of Arizona": ["2017-10-12", "  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, the First Amendment of our \nConstitution gives us this precious freedom of speech that we so \ncherish in America. Contrary to heated debate and public opinion, we, \nin the United States, rarely face the kind of persecution that \nnecessitated this great protection. So I rise today to shed light on \nthe abridgement of freedom of speech that is often widely discussed, \nbut that few Americans ever have to endure.\n  Across the world, Mr. Speaker, individual freedom of speech is \nfrequently infringed. A posted critique or just sharing one's views \nfreely on the internet can be punishable, even by death.\n  Late one evening in September, a well-known Indian journalist, Gauri \nLankesh, was murdered outside her\n\n\nhome. She was ``an anti-establishment figure with a reputation for her \nfearless criticism of undemocratic elements within the parties in \npower.'' The circumstances of her death were ``strikingly similar'' to \nthe murders of three additional Indian activists.\n  Just weeks ago, another of India's most prominent political \njournalists, Professor Kancha Ilaiah, known for critiquing India's \ncaste social order, was threatened by a Hindu member of India's \nparliament. This member of parliament, who is an ally of the current \nBJP government, issued a statement that Kancha should be ``publicly \nhanged.'' Kancha subsequently received numerous death threats.\n  These threats had a significant effect. A mob tried to attack \nProfessor Ilaiah with stones as he and a coworker were driving to a \nmeeting. Kancha is now under self-imposed house arrest because he is \nsimply not safe otherwise.\n  Was Professor Ilaiah's crime significant?\n  Kancha was called a modern-day Dr. Ambedkar, who is known as the \n``Father of the Indian Constitution,'' and Professor Ilaiah's crime was \nhe was the author of ``Why I am Not a Hindu.''\n  A recent translation of his 2009 book ``Post-Hindu India'' is what \nseems to have sparked the threats against him. This book described the \npolarized context of modern-day India specifically dealing with the \nproductivity of the Dalits and the ``low'' castes and the seeming \nspiritual and monetary monopoly of the ``higher'' castes. These \ncritiques became even more relevant in India's growing agrarian crisis, \nthe resulting farmer suicides due to hopelessness, and the massive \njoblessness due to demonetization and economic slowdown.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand on the floor of the United States House of \nRepresentatives to state unequivocally that the United States and the \nentire global community is, and should be, deeply concerned about this \nthreat to the life of Professor Kancha Ilaiah, one of the world's well-\nknown intellectuals.\n  Our trusted ally and friend, India, is better than this, Mr. Speaker. \nProfessor Kancha Ilaiah's right and freedom to speak should not be \ninfringed; and his protection, and that of those like him, should be of \nthe utmost priority to the Indian Government. I am able to express \nfreely this viewpoint because we have freedom of speech in the United \nStates of America, Mr. Speaker. May we remember at what cost and for \nwhat purpose we were given this priceless freedom.\n"], "Mr. BANKS of Indiana": ["2018-03-07", "  Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sergeant \nFirst Class Sammy L. Davis and congratulate him on receiving the Sachem \nAward. The Sachem Award, our state's highest honor, is given annually \nto a Hoosier with a lifetime of excellence and moral virtue that has \nbrought credit and honor to the state of Indiana.\n  Sergeant First Class Davis has certainly met the criteria for this \nprestigious award. As a cannoneer with the 4th Artillery Regiment of \nthe 9th Infantry Division, Sammy was stationed in South Vietnam in \n1967. One day, his unit fell under heavy machine gun and mortar fire \nfrom the Vietcong. Without hesitation, Sammy manned a howitzer to \nprovide cover for his unit. The howitzer caught fire and Sammy was \nblown into a foxhole after being struck by an enemy rifle round. \nSergeant Davis courageously returned to the burning artillery piece to \ncontinue returning fire on the enemy. Although he sustained serious \ninjuries from an enemy mortar round, Sammy picked up an air mattress \nand crossed a nearby river to rescue his wounded comrades.\n  For his actions, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded Sammy the \nCongressional Medal of Honor for extraordinary heroism at the risk of \nhis life in 1968. Additionally, Sergeant First Class Davis was awarded \nthe Silver Star, Purple Heart, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam \nService Medal, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross and Republic of \nVietnam Campaign Medal for his actions.\n  I would like to congratulate Sammy and his wife, Dixie, on receiving \nthis important award. Hoosiers are proud of the accomplishments of \nSergeant First Class Sammy L. Davis and thank him for his service to \nour nation.\n"], "Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina": ["2018-03-05", "  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nholding this Special Order hour to talk about a very critical policy \nand issue for our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, nuclear energy is a critical component of the United \nStates' energy matrix. It is no secret that I am passionate about \nenergy independence and nuclear energy as an essential, emission-free, \ndomestic source of electricity.\n  As we create nuclear energy, we also create nuclear waste. In my \ndistrict, the Oconee Nuclear Station run by Duke Energy in Oconee \nCounty, South Carolina, has 40 years' worth of nuclear waste sitting at \nthe site. Without a permanent geological repository, nuclear waste will \ncontinue to pile up at reactors in South Carolina and all across the \nNation.\n  There is currently estimated to be about 4,500 tons of spent nuclear \nfuel in temporary storage in South Carolina from commercial reactors.\n  Furthermore, there are more than 10,000 tons of military and research \nnuclear waste at the Savannah River site, just outside my district.\n  Nuclear waste sits idle and is stored in dry casts and wet pools in \n121 communities across 39 States. It is imperative that we pass \nChairman Shimkus' legislation, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act, \nto reform our country's nuclear waste policy and utilize Yucca Mountain \nas our main point of nuclear storage.\n  Having nuclear waste dispersed across the country and close to highly \npopulated areas makes zero sense, and is an unnecessary and avoidable \nrisk.\n  The depository at Yucca Mountain, after decades of research, has been \nindependently verified to safely dispose of spent nuclear fuel for a \nmillion years. It is the law of the land. It is a perfect site for \nthis.\n  We as a country need to embrace the law of the land. It is a long-\nterm stable storage facility at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. After all the \nscientific research and money taken from ratepayers, it is time to move \nforward.\n  It is sad that this project has been mothballed because of politics \nand has been used as a political football at the expense of the \nAmerican ratepayers.\n  What do I mean by American ratepayers paying for this?\n  U.S. ratepayers have already paid the Federal Government over $40 \nbillion to develop Yucca Mountain, and currently all U.S. taxpayers are \npaying over $2 million a day because we have not yet fulfilled our \nlegal obligations. Ratepayers are quite literally paying something for \nnothing.\n  Ratepayers in my State of South Carolina have already paid $1.3 \nbillion in fees, which were intended to pay for a functioning Yucca \nMountain nuclear waste repository. Ratepayers in other States which \nutilize nuclear commercial energy have paid billions more.\n  It is time to put politics aside. Authorize what Congress has already \napproved and paid for by Americans. Yucca Mountain should not have \ntaken this long to become a reality; not after colossal amounts of \nmoney have been poured into this infrastructure project.\n  Members on both sides of the aisle, as you see tonight, are \nsupportive of authorizing the use of Yucca Mountain through the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act Amendments. It voted out of the House Energy and \nCommerce Committee by a vote of 49-4. Let's not let the politics of a \nfew get in the way of reforming our nuclear waste policy and ensuring \nAmericans get what they have already paid billions into.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership, and I look \nforward to working with him to move this forward."], "Mr. GRAVES of Georgia": ["2018-01-30", "  Mr. GRAVES of Georgia.

Mr. Speaker, what a great opportunity to really stand up \nhere and smile and talk to the American public with the words of \nconstituents from Michigan's First District, because these are not my \nwords. These are their words over the last 2\\1/2\\ months or so since we \npassed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n  You know, in November 2016, the great people of Michigan's First \nDistrict sent me to Washington with a direct, yet simple, mandate: Get \nWashington, D.C., out of our pockets and off our backs. For a marine, \nthat is a pretty simple mission-oriented instruction.\n  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was the first major step to accomplishing \nthat goal. Since we passed tax reform, I have travelled throughout many \nof the First District's 32 counties talking with constituents, business \nowners, and hearing their individual stories. Farmers, businesses, both \nlarge and small, and families are already seeing the benefits that tax \nreform brings, and we are just getting started.\n  Many of these small companies said: Well, I don't know yet, but I \nhave got to meet with my accountant around the middle of April, and \nthen we will really see.\n  But now they are starting to see wage increases and bonuses, and \nbusiness expansions are all beginning to roll in and take effect, and \nit is long overdue in our neck of the woods. And when I say, ``our neck \nof the woods,'' that is not a figurative statement. That is a literal \nstatement.\n  You know, many families in our district live paycheck to paycheck, \nand even a small crisis could send them into a tailspin. An extra $100 \nor $150 in a paycheck in my district is not crumbs. It is not \nArmageddon. It is a big plus. It gives that family flexibility to live \ntheir life and to raise their kids and be a proud community--wage-\nearning members of that community.\n  That $1,000 a year may mean a new set of snow tires. And by the way, \nwe only have, roughly, a little over 2 weeks of winter left, but we use \nour snow tires up there through about mid-May. That is just the way it \nworks.\n  That money might go for the kids to play on a sports team. Hockey is \nnot a cheap sport to put your son or daughter in. Or it could be, \npossibly, just saving up in that family rainy day fund for an \nemergency.\n  We hear of businesses from Boyne City to Marquette expanding, growing \ntheir staff, raising wages, all a result of a fairer and simpler Tax \nCode.\n  You know, when I talk to some folks, they say: You know what, I don't \nmind working. I am proud to work. The dignity of work is what makes me \nstrong as an individual, what makes me strong as a mother or a father.\n\n\n  They just think, in some ways, it is just not fair if you don't earn \nyour wage. So there is a certain sense of pride that goes along with \nthat.\n\n\n  We all know that if you are looking for thanks, running for office \nprobably isn't the field of work you should get into. Yet everywhere I \ngo in the district these last couple of months, constituents have been \ncoming up to me saying: Thank you.\n  They don't know who I am. We get to talking, and they say: You are \nthe guy on TV. Yeah. Well, thank you for what you did. Thank you for \npassing tax reform.\n  Just a few weeks ago, I was at the Home Depot in Petoskey, and a \ngentleman who was working there pulled me aside and thanked me for \ngetting tax reform done. That allowed him to keep more of his check \nplus a sizable bonus that was paid by Home Depot.\n  In the Upper Peninsula, U.S. Special Delivery gave all 200 employees \n$1,000 bonuses after tax reform passed because of the money that they \nwill save as a company on their taxes this year.\n  A couple of weeks back, when I was in Traverse City, Traverse City \nState Bank announced that they are giving out new bonuses.\n  So many more businesses in the First District are raising wages, \nadding workers, giving bonuses, and expanding.\n  We know that this is just the beginning, and Americans can expect \nmuch more in the days ahead because of the energy that we have put into \nthe growth of our American economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, this confirms the very core beliefs that I have and \nconservatives all throughout the country believe in. If we get the \nFederal Government off our back, where it is not supposed to be, and \nout of our pockets, we will unleash unprecedented economic potential \nfor the citizens of our great country.\n  I would just close with one note, and that is I am Scandinavian, and \nthere is a wonderful delicacy that you can only afford at the holidays, \nand I think more people are able to afford it now, and it is called a \ncrumb cake, and it is great."], "Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico": ["2018-05-18", "  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico.

We can cast blame where we want to cast blame, but, I think, \nfor the record, it is important to know that I have been offering all \nday to vote.\n  I would like nothing more than to vote, but it is the other side. It \nis the leadership that has refused to allow any amendments. So we have \nwhat is called a closed debate. There will be no amendments. There will \nbe no questioning of the authority.

I don't advocate for shutting the government down, but neither \ndo I advocate for keeping it open and borrowing $1 million a minute. In \nfact, the statistics this year are closer to $2 million a minute.\n  This is a government that is horribly broken. This is a system that \nis horribly broken, and Senator after Senator will come up quietly, and \nthey will say: Oh, this is the last time I am voting for a continuing \nresolution. This is terrible.

Four times in 40 years have we actually done our job where we \nvoted on each individual appropriations bill.\n  Earlier today, I went through some of the waste. It is amazing the \nwaste that has been going on. William Proxmire was first pointing out \nthis waste in 1968. One of the examples he pointed to was that money \nwas being spent studying why men fall in love with women. You may be \ncurious about that, too. If you are, ask your friends to get \nCrowdsourcing, and you could get a study of why men fall in love with \nwomen. That is not a function of government. That waste goes on decade \nafter decade, and nothing is ever fixed.\n  What we have is a 700-page bill that will not have been read by \nanyone. I was just reading some of the things that will be stuck in \nthere. Nobody will have any idea how they got in there--all of the \nspending glommed together in one bill with no oversight.\n  This is a terrible, rotten, no-good way to run your government, and \nit has been going on decade after decade. Everyone admits it is a \nterrible, rotten, no-good way to run your government. Yet nobody stands \nup and says enough is enough. They say: It is a binary choice, young \nman. Take it or leave it. I will leave it.\n  I don't want to shut down the government, but somebody ought to \ninsist that we have an open amendment process. Someone should insist \nthat we root out waste in government. We have had a partial audit of \nthe Pentagon, and we\n\n\nfound out that $800 million was misplaced or lost. What has been done \nso far in the audit showed over $100 billion has been wasted in the \nPentagon. So what do we do? We reward them with more money. We have \nbeen trying to get a complete audit of this Pentagon for 17 years, and \nyou know what they argue? They say: We are too big to be audited. How \ngalling is that, when your government tells you that we are too big to \nbe audited?\n  This goes on decade after decade. Everybody in Washington complains \nabout it. All the constituents complain about it. All of America \ncomplains about it. Yet we do it time after time. Then, people say: \nWell, look, this is a bipartisan deal. Kumbaya. Republicans and \nDemocrats are holding hands to spend more money.\n  It is the opposite of what you want. You want compromise in \nWashington, but we should be compromising to spend less money, not \nmore. Every one of the Republicans--count them; you can look it up on \nthe internet--said that President Barack Obama was a spendthrift and he \nhad trillion-dollar deficits, and we railed day in and day out, year in \nand year out against it, and rightfully so.\n  It was too much debt and too much spending. We were against that. \nThat is what I ran for office on. I am not about to turn my head the \nother way and say it is fine because my party is doing it. That is what \nthis is about. It is pure, empty, partisan politics, where people are \nsaying: It is OK for Republicans to have debts, but it was bad for \nDemocrats to have debts.\n  It is time we stood up and said it is a rotten system and it should \nend.\n  How will it end? It is never going to end by people always passing \nthe buck and saying: Oh, I am voting; this is my last continuing \nresolution. I hate continuing resolutions. They are terrible. This is \nmy last one, but I am going to vote for one more--maybe next year or \nactually in a month, because we will be doing this again in a month.\n  Do you realize that we are on our fourth continuing resolution? This \nhas nothing to do with the budget, and the media confuses this. They \nsay we have a budget deal. No, we have a continuing resolution deal. \nThis is not a budget. This isn't some sort of plan. This hasn't gone \nthrough a committee. There are no appropriations bills that have gone \nthrough committee. There is no oversight happening to your government. \nSo when I tell you that $356,000 was spent last year studying what \nhappens to Japanese quail when they are on cocaine--whether they are \nmore sexually promiscuous on cocaine--this is what your government is \nspending money on. But it doesn't get any better because we never root \nout the waste. In fact, the agency that has been doing this research \nends up getting more every year.\n  They are like: Oh, we like science. If you like science, you will \nlike this one. They took $700,000 from autism research, and they spent \nit studying what Neil Armstrong said when he was on the moon. Did he \nsay ``one small step for man,'' or did he say ``one small step for a \nman''? We spent $700,000 studying whether the preposition ``a'' was in \nNeil Armstrong's statement. That is $700,000 that should have been \nspent on autism.\n  This isn't really just about fiscal conservatism, although it is. It \nis about how best to spend money for legitimate expenses. Every time \nyou spend money in a wasted way, you are taking away from something \nthat presumably was less wasteful. So this is a big deal.\n  Do I want to shut down the government? No. But do I want to keep it \nopen and not reform it? Hell, no. That is what is going on. It is a \ntrillion-dollar deficit this year. It is going to be bigger, probably, \nbut we were approaching a trillion dollars before they added $300 \nbillion of new spending to this. So this is a problem. This is a big \ndeal.\n  I have said all day long that I will vote. Start the process. Open \nthe doors. We could have had 40 amendments today. We have been at this \nall day, with the other side blocking amendments, trying to have no \ndebate and trying to close the door so a secret deal--a deal done in \nsecret--can be forced on everyone else.\n  So yes, we should have debate. Yes, we should have a vote. Let's have \na vote tonight on amendments. Let's have amendments. Let's determine \nwhether the American people or the Senate are really in favor of \nbusting the caps.\n  I have one amendment. I am not asking for a dozen amendments. I am \nnot asking for 100 amendments or 1,000 amendments. I am asking for one. \nIt takes 15 minutes.\n  So realize that all day these people wanted to paint a picture. They \nare embarrassed, and I understand that. They are embarrassed by this \nsituation because they know the hypocrisy is thicker than pea soup. \nThey know the hypocrisy is out there. They railed and they railed \nagainst President Obama's debt--trillion-dollar deficits. Every one of \nthem railed against it, and now they have to vote tonight for a \ntrillion-dollar deficit. That is the problem here. So there is a \ncertain embarrassment to bring this up. The embarrassment causes them \nto say: We don't want any amendments. We don't want to discuss this. \nThey ought to be discussed, and so much more should be discussed.\n  It isn't just that we are blocking amendments or debate on spending \nor that we are not doing our job on appropriations bills. We are also \nnot doing our constitutional duty on the declaration of war. This was \nsomething the Founding Fathers were explicit on. The power to declare \nwar was given to Congress in article I, section 8--given to Congress. \nIn fact, there is discussion of this. There was extensive discussion of \nthis. Almost every Founding Father weighed in on the fact that war \nshould be declared by the legislature. Madison put it this way. He said \nthat the executive branch is most prone to war; therefore, with steady \ncare, that power was vested in the legislature.\n\n  When was the last time we declared war? Well, officially, we haven't \ndeclared war since World War II, but we have sort of voted. At least we \ncame to Congress--at least George Bush came to Congress when we went to \nAfghanistan the first time and when we went to Iraq the first time, and \nthere were votes. But those votes were long ago, nearly a generation \nago. They really don't apply to anything we are doing now, and there is \na certain intellectual dishonesty by those who continue to say that the \nvote to go into Afghanistan has anything to do with what we are doing \nover there now. There is no military solution there, and that also ties \ninto our budgetary problems.\n  We do not have enough money to build nations around the world and \nthink that we can build our Nation here at home. So when people talk \nabout nation building, I say: Yes, you are right, but we need to do \nsome nation building here.\n  The President has talked about a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, but \nthere is no money for it. So we are borrowing $1 trillion before we get \nstarted with people advocating for a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. \nThere is no money. If we want to find the money, we have to make \ndifficult choices.\n  As people come to my office, they say: We want money for X; we want \nmoney for Y; we want money for Z. I listen carefully, I listen \nsympathetically, and I try to say: Look, we are a rich country. We \nought to be able to do what you are asking. Yet we have a $1 trillion \ndeficit, and everything has to be reflected by the fact that we are out \nof money and horribly spending a great excess of what comes in. But \nnobody is making these difficult choices because we just keep adding on \nto the tab. We basically just borrow more money.\n  When President Obama was President, we were--under George W. Bush, we \nwent from $5 trillion to $10 trillion in total debt. With President \nObama, we went from $10 trillion to $20 trillion. We are almost at that \nsame curve again. In fact, we may be escalating that curve as we speak. \nAs Republicans, we all criticized that enormous debt and said that it \nwas a bad thing for our government. There was a debt commission, and \nthere was all of this discussion and a lot of pandering. I was one of \nthose who was concerned, and I am still concerned.\n  We have this debt that continues to escalate. Yet what do Republicans \ndo when they are in charge? You remember the stories. If you were asked \nto help Republicans, they said: Well, we took over the House, but that \nwill only--we control one-half of one-third of government. We can't get \neverything we want. So it didn't happen.\n\n\n  Then we took over the Senate. We controlled one-third of government, \nand they said: Well, we have to have the Presidency.\n  Then, lo and behold, we won the Presidency. We have all of the \nbranches of government, yet we still are putting forward a spending \nbill that will be the equivalent of a $1 trillion deficit.\n  Is it wrong to point that out? Is it wrong to want better of your own \nparty? Is it wrong to think that we ought to do our job, that we ought \nto go into an appropriations process? The House actually did it. People \nsay: Oh, we can't do that anymore. The House of Representatives passed \nall 12 appropriations bills. It can be done.\n  Actually, maybe it is not the panacea I would hope in the sense that \nthere is still too much money being spent, even in the appropriations \nprocess. It really needs to go hand in hand with two things. We should \nstill do the appropriations bill. There are 12 departments of \ngovernment; let's pass them one at a time. But we should also keep in \nmind, as we are spending money or voting to spend money, that the \nConstitution limits very much what the Congress can do. There are \nenumerated powers given to Congress under article I, section 8. That is \nwhat we are supposed to do. This was a big deal to the Founding \nFathers. In fact, they were very specific that those rights not listed \nwere not to be disparaged, so the listing of the Bill of Rights was a \npartial listing of your rights. But they were also very careful to say \nthat the powers that were granted to the Federal Government were a \ncomplete list, and anything not listed in the powers granted would be \nretained by the people and the States--by the States and the people, \nrespectively.\n  Part of our problem is that we decided we wanted a government that is \neverything to everyone. You ask yourself: Is one party better than the \nother? Maybe at times. But, really--if you are looking for \nresponsibility--they want to cast blame. All of a sudden, I, myself, am \nsomehow responsible for the whole problem here. Actually, I have made \nthem angry, and they are very upset with me because I have made it \ndifficult. We are going to have to be up late tonight, and they are \nangry that I am pointing out their hypocrisy. That is a big problem, \nand nobody likes to have that pointed out. But if we don't, if we just \ncontinue on this course, I think there is a great danger to the Nation.\n  I think there is a day of reckoning coming, and I think that our debt \neventually could get the better of us, that it could really threaten \nthe underpinnings, the undergirding of our country, and it could do it \nin a couple of different ways.\n  For some time now, we have manipulated interest rates through the \nFederal Reserve. We kept them below the market rate, which led to a \nhuge housing bubble and a housing correction. We don't really have a \nhousing bubble happening, but many of you may have noticed that there \nhas been a huge stock market bubble. There is a question as to whether \nthe fury of that has been fed by Fed policy and whether the desire to \nkeep interest rates low to make it cheap to borrow money--whether \nsomeday we will have a boom that leads to a bust. I really think that \nis a worry.\n  The stock market has been very jittery in the last few days. I think \nsome of that has to do--it is funny how people interpret it. Some on \nthe left will say: Oh, the stock market is jittery because the \ngovernment might shut down for 2 hours. That is the dumbest thing I \nhave ever heard in my life. But it could be, perhaps, that they are \njittery because we have a government that is profligate in its \nspending, is perpetually spending more than comes in, and has such a \ngreat imbalance that maybe one-third of what we are doing here is \nfinanced.\n\n  They say: Well, it would be one thing to actually finance a house or \nsomething like that, but if you are financing your rent or if you are \nfinancing your groceries each month, there is a problem. We are having \ntrouble paying our day-to-day expenses because we are borrowing them.\n  Much has been said about the military needing money, and I believe in \na strong national defense. In fact, I believe that our national defense \nis actually the most important thing the Federal Government does. It is \none of those things that State government can't do. So, yes, I want a \nstrong national defense, but you have to ask yourself whether a $20 \ntrillion debt makes us a stronger country or a weaker country.\n  I think it was Admiral Milligan who said that, currently, the No. 1 \nthreat to our country is our national debt. There is this question of \nwhether an insolvent nation can be a strong nation.\n  As we look through this, I think it would be wise to look at the \nspending bill and say: This is not the way we should run a government, \nand we, as Republicans--if we really, truly are conservative--should be \nputting forward something that looks toward balance, at the very least, \ninstead of going the opposite way.\n  I would ask the Senate to really take a look at themselves, to look \nin the mirror and say: Is this really what we stand for? Is this what \nwe have been running for all these years, to control government and \nthen be no different from our counterparts across the aisle?\n  I think today is a day of reflection but hopefully a day where there \nwill be some who will say: Enough is enough. I am not going to do it \nanymore."], "Mr. YOUNG": ["2018-01-18", "  Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that is very \nimportant to Hoosiers: protecting our unborn children. Right now, \nHoosiers from across the State of Indiana are traveling to Washington, \nDC, to take part in tomorrow's March for Life. This annual event brings \ntogether the unsung heroes of the life movement--those who have \ndedicated their lives to saving innocent children.\n  Now, despite what is often portrayed in the media, life-affirming \nprinciples are supported by a majority of Americans. A poll by POLITICO \nand the Harvard T.H. Chan School for Public Health showed that 58 \npercent of Americans--almost three in five Americans--oppose allowing \nMedicaid funding to be used for abortion.\n  According to the Quinnipiac University polling, 60 percent of \nAmericans, including 46 percent of Democrats, support Federal \nlegislation limiting abortion after 20 weeks.\n  I am proud to cosponsor the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. \nThis act would protect unborn children at 20 weeks postfertilization--\nthe point at which scientific evidence proves abortion inflicts pain.\n  It is estimated that this commonsense legislation will save roughly \n12,000 to 18,000 babies annually, and it will not apply, incidentally, \nto cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk.\n  Before being elected to the U.S. Senate, I sat on the board of \ndirectors of Hannah House. This is in Bloomington, IN, where I live. It \noffers women loving support during pregnancy.\n  I further spent 2 years as a smalltown attorney in little Paoli, IN, \nand I offered free legal services for parents who wanted to adopt. So \nyou can see why I am very passionate about helping children find loving \nhomes and helping caring adults become parents. I have seen firsthand, \nthrough my own experiences, the importance of advocating for those who \ncannot advocate for themselves.\n  The United States is one of only seven countries in the world that \nallows abortions after 20 weeks. This list includes human rights \nviolators like China and North Korea. This isn't company we want to \nkeep.\n  During this time, when there is principled disagreement on so many\n\n\nissues--Republicans disagreeing with Democrats, conservatives \ndisagreeing with progressives, surely, we can come together and take \naction that a significant majority of Americans want. So I am hopeful \nthis critical legislation will receive a vote on the Senate floor very \nsoon.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Mr. GRAHAM": ["2018-02-08", "  Mr. GRAHAM. Regular order."], "Mr. MURPHY": ["2018-04-25", "  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on the \npending nomination of Mike Pompeo to be the Secretary of State. As a \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee, I opposed the nomination in \ncommittee, and I will oppose it on the floor.\n  I have said publicly that this was not an open-and-shut case for me. \nFrankly, I would submit that I have probably voted for more of the \nPresident's nominees who have come before the Senate than have many of \nmy colleagues. I do believe in giving a substantial amount of deference \nto the President in the choices that he makes of those who are to serve \nhim in his administration. There have been a number of applicants for \nCabinet posts whom I have supported even though I have had grave \nmisgivings about the policies that they were going to be articulating \nand that they were going to be carrying out.\n  I also believe Director Pompeo when he talks about the morale crisis \nat the Department of State and his sincere desire to try to remedy that \nand address it. There was a morale crisis at the Department of State \nafter Secretary Tillerson waged an assault on diplomats in his trying \nto push out as many as he could for over a year, changing work \nrequirements to make it harder for people to live in very difficult \nplaces around the world and continuing a hiring freeze well past the \npoint at which it was justified. There are a lot of people who serve in \nthis country here in Washington and abroad who need to be told that \ntheir work is valuable again, and I believe Mike Pompeo when he talks \nabout the need to try to engage in that morale-building project.\n  I think there are check marks on the side of the ledger that would \nargue for Mike Pompeo's confirmation, but I am going to vote no \nbecause, unfortunately, I think there are far more check marks on the \nother side of the ledger.\n  I want to talk today about the issue of qualifications. I don't argue \nwith the fact that our choices, as those in the Senate, when it comes \nto those who are picked for the Cabinet, shouldn't really be about \npolicy differences. Sometimes the policy differences will be so serious \nthat Members of the President's opposing party may have to cast a \n``no'' vote. By and large, I do think that we should be evaluating \ncandidates based on their qualifications and based on whether their \nviews are at least between the 20-yard lines, within the mainstream \nconversation about the portfolio of issues that they are going to \nundertake to oversee.\n  So I want to talk today about my belief that Director Pompeo is not \nqualified to be our next Secretary of State. I think that is the \nappropriate conversation for us to be having, and I want to talk about \nit through the prism of three qualifications that I would argue any \nSecretary of State has to meet.\n  One is that a Secretary of State who is going to be advising the \nPresident on matters of war and peace and on questions of military \noperations overseas has to believe in his heart or in her heart in the \nConstitution--in the separation of powers between the executive and the \nlegislative branches--when it comes to war-making.\n  The second is that a Secretary of State has to believe in the value \nof diplomacy. The Secretary of State is in\n\n\nthe national security cabinet in order to represent diplomatic pathways \nout of very complicated, vexing, and dangerous problems around the \nglobe. You need a Secretary of State who truly believes that diplomacy \ncan be a viable path out of very complicated problems.\n  Third, you need a Secretary of State who is free of prejudice or who \nis free of a substantial association with prejudice. This is our \nNation's chief diplomat, who is going to be representing the United \nStates all over the world, who is going to try to build bridges between \nour country and those countries with different cultures, different \nfaiths, different backgrounds, and different ways of viewing the world.\n  On these three tests, I don't believe that Director Pompeo measures \nup. Let me talk about each one of them very briefly.\n  The first is this belief in the separation of powers. If we aren't \nstanding up for article I powers, no one else will. The Founding \nFathers were very clear that when it came to military engagement \noutside of the United States, it was the Congress and only the Congress \nthat had the ability to declare war. Now, admittedly, war is a much \nfuzzier concept today than it was when armies were marching against \neach other in open fields and when neat, tidy peace treaties were \nwrapping up those hostilities. So I will grant my colleagues that \ndeclarations of war are a little bit harder today when the enemies \nnever seem to go away and the definition of ``hostilities'' is a little \ndifferent than it used to be.\n  Yet, at the hearing, I asked a series of questions of Director \nPompeo, whose answers did not leave me with any confidence that he \nunderstood that there still must be some places in which only the \nCongress can declare hostilities. Now, I don't believe the President \nhas the ability to take military action against the Syrian regime \nwithout having the authorization of Congress. Apparently, there are \nmembers of the President's Cabinet who believe the same thing. Media \nreports suggest that Secretary Mattis counseled the President to go to \nCongress first before attacking the Syrian regime.\n  So I queried Director Pompeo about this topic. I asked him whether \nthere was any attack that had been launched against the United States \nfrom the Syrian regime. His answer was no.\n  I asked him whether there was any threat of imminent attack from the \nSyrian regime against the United States. His answer was no.\n  I then asked him what the authorization was that allowed the \nPresident to take this action. His answer was ``article II authority,'' \nwhich is kind of a blanket answer for anybody in an administration who \ndoesn't have an answer.\n  I submit that the Obama administration occasionally relied on article \nII authority as well, but I tried to give Director Pompeo a way out of \nthat overly broad answer.\n  I asked: Would you identify for me one limiting factor on this broad \nclaim of article II authority. He could not. He could not articulate \none definable, articulated restraint on article II military authority \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  It speaks to what, I think, is a belief inside this administration, \nwhich is now being buoyed by people like Director Pompeo and John \nBolton, that the President has virtually unlimited authority to begin \nmilitary operations overseas. If you can attack the Syrian regime \nwithout having any authorization from Congress, then why couldn't the \nPresident launch a military attack against North Korea without going to \nCongress in the way that John Bolton had recommended in some of his \nwritings before joining the administration?\n  If a Secretary of State is not prepared to argue that the \nConstitution requires that authority and cannot even articulate a \nsingle restraint on a seemingly limitless power under article II to \nlaunch attacks overseas without going to Congress, then who is making \nthat argument?\n  I think a Secretary of State has to have an understanding of the \nlimits of executive power overseas. I don't think Director Pompeo has \nthat belief. Otherwise, he would have answered very differently the \nquestions that he was given in his confirmation hearing.\n  Secondly, I believe that a baseline qualification to be the Secretary \nof State, to be the Nation's chief diplomat, is to believe in the \nfundamental power of diplomacy. Over and over, primarily when he was a \nCongressman, Director Pompeo showed us that he didn't think much of \nAmerican diplomatic power. He opposed the JCPOA, which is, of course, a \nmainstream opinion within the Republican Party, but he did so because \nhe thought that military action would involve just a few thousand \nsorties--American planes flying over Iran, bombing the country into \nsubmission. I think that is a pretty naive, uneducated view of how a \nwar with Iran would go down, but it demonstrates an enthusiasm for \nmilitary options ahead of diplomatic options, the kind that may be \nbetter suited for the Department of Defense than for the Department of \nState.\n\n  He has further cheered on this President as he has pulled out of the \nParis climate accords, as he has attacked multilateral alliances that \nthe United States has long been a part of. This is a candidate for \nSecretary of State who has a long history of critiquing and criticizing \ndiplomatic paths to solving complicated problems around the world.\n  I want a cheerleader for diplomacy at the Department of State. We \nhave been missing that for the last 1\\1/2\\ years with Secretary \nTillerson. It doesn't seem we are going to remedy that. I think a \nqualification for Secretary of State is to be a cheerleader for \ndiplomacy. That has not been the reputation or the record of Mike \nPompeo.\n  Lastly, I think you need to be free of prejudice or free of \nsubstantial association with prejudice, and the reason for this \nqualification is self-evident. This is the member of the administration \nwho is going to be most often overseas meeting with leaders that come \nfrom very different backgrounds, who believe different things than \nAmericans do, who practice different religions than the majority of \nAmericans do, who have different traditions than the majority of \nAmericans do. So one has to have a respect, right? One has to have a \nlove of other people who come from different faiths and different \ntraditions if you are going to take this job.\n  This may be the blackest mark on Director Pompeo's record because \nthere is a vast network all across this country that engages in a kind \nof Islamophobia, a hatred and bigotry toward the Muslim faith that is \ncompletely un-American but is also deeply antithetical to American \nnational security interests because if we really want to make this \ncountry safe, then we have to be building constant active bridges to \nMuslim communities in the United States and to our Muslim partners \naround the world. When you trade in Islamophobia, a fear of Muslims, \nyou are adding bulletin board material to recruiters who want to write \na story about how America is at war with the East, how America is at \nwar with the Islamic faith.\n  For much of his congressional career, Mike Pompeo was deeply \nintertwined with this network of anti-Muslim organizations. There is a \nreally interesting study that I hope some of you will take a look at \nthat details this network of organizations. They have fairly innocuous-\nsounding names, like the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, the \nMiddle East Forum, the Investigative Project on Terrorism, Jihad Watch, \nACT for America, the Center for Security Policy, the Society of \nAmericans for National Existence. Those sound like things I might be \nfor, but if you really take a look at what they do, they preach \nintolerance. They try to tell Americans that all Muslims are out to get \nthem and that we are better off if we just shelter ourselves from \npeople of the Muslim faith. That makes us less safe, and it morally \nweakens us as a nation. It is not coincidental that all of these groups \nsprang up or began to receive substantial funding after Barack Obama \nbecame President of the United States. It wasn't coincidental that as \nDonald Trump was going on cable news casting doubt on whether the \nPresident of the United States was really an American citizen or \nwhether he was a secret Kenyan citizen planted in the United States \nthat all of these organizations started to take root. They gained \nlegitimacy because American political leaders associated themselves \nwith their cause because they were able to lure Members of Congress \nlike Mike Pompeo into their web.\n  Mike Pompeo went on these radio shows that traded in these conspiracy\n\n\ntheories about Muslims. He allowed for his name and his office to be \nassociated with their causes. At one point, he actually accepted an \naward from a group called ACT for America, which is arguably the \nlargest anti-Muslim group in America. They gave him an award saying \nthat ``Representative Mike Pompeo has been a steadfast ally of ours \nsince the day he was elected to Congress.'' This is an organization \nthat the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center \nclassify as a hate group. Their founder said practicing Muslims \n``cannot be loyal citizens of the United States.''\n  Let me say that again. The founder of the group that gave Mike Pompeo \nan award for being a steadfast ally of their cause said that practicing \nMuslims cannot be loyal citizens of the United States. These anti-\nMuslim groups became stronger, became more deeply intertwined into the \nmainstream because they have allies like Mike Pompeo. It wasn't a \ncoincidence when a Presidential candidate stood up and said: If you \nelect me, I will ban all Muslims from the United States, that he wasn't \nlaughed off the debate stage. He wasn't laughed off the debate stage \nbecause this conspiracy of Islamophobia had penetrated the mainstream \nbecause of its access to people like the nominee to be Secretary of \nState. That is disqualifying to me. That is not about Mike Pompeo's \nviews. It is not about my differences with the policies he is going to \nespouse as a Secretary of State. That speaks to his qualifications.\n  This is one of the most important debates we are going to have. These \nare exceptional times for both Republicans and Democrats, dealing with \nan administration that conducts itself very differently from others. \nWhen it comes down to it, I don't think that by casting a ``no'' vote I \nam violating the traditions of this body, which have admittedly given \ndeference to the President in some of these choices for Cabinet \npositions.\n  I don't think Mike Pompeo really understands the importance of the \nseparation of powers between the Congress and the Executive when it \ncomes to war-making. I don't think this is a Secretary of State who is \ngoing to walk into the room when big decisions are being made on \nforeign policy and argue the diplomacy portfolio. By virtue of his \nlongstanding association with groups that argued values antithetical to \na diverse America, arguing that Muslims have no place in this country, \nI don't think he passes the test when it comes to a Secretary of State \nwho doesn't have an association with prejudice. That would disqualify \nhim from being an effective advocate for us in parts of the world that \npractice faiths different than ours. So, for those reasons, I am going \nto be voting no on Mike Pompeo's nomination. At the same time, as I \nsaid at the outset, I acknowledge there are arguments for his \nnomination, and I will hope my fears are unfounded. I will hope that \nhe, if he gets confirmation from this body--which it looks like he \nwill--is an advocate for diplomacy, that he understands the proper role \nof Congress, and that he represents all Americans when he serves us \noverseas. I certainly hope that to be the case. I hope I am wrong about \nmy reservations, but I will still cast a ``no'' vote when his \nnomination comes before the Congress.\n  I yield the floor."], "Mr. CURBELO of Florida": ["2018-03-07", "  Mr. CURBELO of Florida.

Puerto Rico needs all the help it can \nget--and these young leaders are to be commended for helping the \nIsland's residents during these difficult times.\n  By engaging fellow students to raise money at a bowling event, Troop \n2672 was able to rally a community around an important cause. It is \ninspiring to see young people identifying a purpose and then taking \nmeaningful steps to help.\n  Puerto Rico and New York City have long shared a powerful bond, and \nit is too often forgotten that the people of Puerto Rico are American \ncitizens. The efforts of these dedicated Girl Scouts are an important \nreminder that we cannot turn our backs on the Island.\n  It is great to see young women taking leadership roles and making a \ndifference in both their local communities and for Puerto Rico. My best \nwishes to Troop 2672 as they continue the school year and Girl Scout \nactivities and projects. I am heartened by their resolve and inspired \nby their desire to lend a helping hand. These young leaders make all \nNew Yorkers proud.\n"], "Mr. FLAKE": ["2018-03-06", "  Mr. FLAKE.

I think there were \n39 votes in favor. We had bipartisan support for a countermeasure that \nI supported, but we failed to get the 60 votes as well. We got only 54.\n  I would love to get a permanent solution. I have been working my \nentire 18 years in this body to try to get comprehensive immigration \nreform through.

That is, simply, too much to bite off at this \ntime.\n  As much as I don't like to do it, I am offering something that is a \nstopgap, but at least it is for 3 years. At least it will give 3 years \nto those who are affected and give us in Congress some time to actually \ncome to a solution. What we cannot do is force these kids through more \nuncertainty. I would love to get to a permanent solution. That is what \nI have tried to do for a number of years here.

However, there \nhave been concerns raised that the current definition of this section, \nfollowing revisions during the committee consideration, could open this \nprovision to a wider group of financial institutions.\n  I know that was not the intent of my colleagues, and this technical \ncorrection amendment makes clear that section 402 applies only when the \nprimary focus of the banking organization is custodial activities.\n  Section 402 is not intended to provide relief to an organization \nengaged in consumer banking, investment banking, or other businesses, \nand that also happens to have some custodial business or a banking \nsubsidiary that engages in custodial activities.\n  In conclusion, section 402 was intended as a very narrowly tailored \nprovision, focused on true custodial banks.

Mr. President, I rise again today to speak further on S. \n2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection \nAct.\n  We have had a lot of discussion on the floor about this bill in the \nlast few days. Anybody who took the opportunity to watch all of that \ndebate sees that there is a strong bipartisan support for this bill and \na strong debate coming from some quarters trying to say that the bill \ncreates greater risk in our financial community. I would like to \naddress exactly what this bill does and then respond to some of those \ncharges, which I consider to be completely unfounded.\n  The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act \nis aimed at rightsizing regulation for financial institutions--\nincluding community banks and credit unions--making it easier for \nconsumers to get mortgages and to obtain credit.\n  I have said a number of times, and I will repeat, back when we were \ndebating the Dodd-Frank legislation about 10 years ago, it was marketed \nto the public as a bill to address excesses and problems on Wall Street \nby the big megabanks of our country, but its provisions hit hardest on \nMain Street.\n  As I have said, I actually held a news conference in Boise, ID--in my \nhome State--on Main Street. I said the crosshairs of this bill and the \nbulls-eye are on Main Street, not Wall Street.\n  What has happened in the last 10 years? The Wall Street banks have \nbeen phenomenally profitable. They have been very successful, and the \nsmaller banks--the credit unions, the community banks, even the \nregional banks--have been hammered.\n  We are losing credit unions and, more specifically, community banks \nacross this Nation at an alarming pace, and the reason--the primary \nreason--is the phenomenally significant increased regulatory burden \nthey face.\n  I have heard colleagues of mine on the floor in the last couple of \ndays talking about specific community banks and credit unions in their \nStates that have had so much pressure put on them, so much burden and \nfinancial costs put on them by the excessive regulations that they have \neither gone out of business or stopped issuing mortgages, just stopped \ndoing mortgage business or stopped doing loans of certain types that \nare beneficial to our small businesses. So the real victims aren't even \njust the community banks and credit unions; they are the people--the \npeople who want to get a loan in their local communities and who are \nentirely worthy of getting a loan to buy a house, but their credit \nunions and community banks are no longer in that business or they are \nno longer in existence. That is what this bill is addressing.\n  The bill also increases important consumer protections for veterans, \nsenior citizens, victims of fraud, and those who fall on tough \nfinancial times. The provisions in this bill will directly address some \nof the problems I frequently hear about from financial institutions. \nLet me explain in a little more detail just what that is. I have \nalready discussed some.\n\n\n  Community banks and credit unions are simple institutions, focused on \nrelationship lending and have special relationships with the people in \ntheir communities. The bankers and their customers go to church, play \nball, or their kids go to school with each other. They know their \ncustomers, and they are willing to work with them to help them be \nsuccessful. They provide credit to traditionally underserved and rural \ncommunities, where it may be harder to access banking products and \nservices or to get a loan.\n  Dodd-Frank instituted numerous new mortgage rules and complex capital \nrequirements on community banks and credit unions that have hindered \nconsumers' access to mortgage credit and lending more broadly.\n  I guess I will just insert here, this phenomenon we often see in \nWashington of one-size-fits-all or cookie-cutter solutions to a problem \nis directly the kind of problem we are seeing here.\n  Our smaller financial institutions are treated as though they were \nlarge megabanks and as though their business models and their \nportfolios contain the same kind of risk as the larger banks. Yet they \ndon't have the same business models; they don't have the same risk \nfootprint, but they are forced to go through phenomenally expensive \nregulatory burdens for no good reason.\n  I can't tell you how many of these small bank and credit union folks \nhave said to me: Our industry did not cause or have any part in the \nfinancial crisis, but we are being asked to pay the price. That is what \nthis bill deals with.\n  In July of 2016, the American Action Forum attempted to estimate the \nnumber of paperwork hours and final costs associated with these rules \nand regulations that I am talking about. In total, the forum estimated \nthat the law had imposed more than $36 billion in final rule costs and \n73 million paperwork hours as of July 2016. What does that mean? To put \nthese figures into perspective, the costs are nearly $112 per person or \n$310 per household.\n  Additionally, it would take 36,950 employees--that is 36,950 \nemployees--working full time to complete a single year of the law's \npaperwork based on the agency's calculations themselves.\n  Our bill is focused on providing meaningful relief to our community \nbanks and credit unions, helping them to prudently lend to consumers, \nhome buyers, and small businesses--small businesses that we all \nacknowledge are the engines of our economy, yet lack credit and lack \naccess to capital because of these unnecessary rules. That is why the \nfirst part of the name of this bill is ``economic growth.'' This bill \nwill provide a needed shot in the arm for our economy across this \ncountry.\n\n  By responsibly expanding the qualified mortgage safe harbor, \naddressing severe appraiser shortages in rural areas, reducing \nsuperfluous HMDA reporting requirements, and exempting certain loans \nfrom escrow requirements, our bill will ease the compliance and \nregulatory reporting requirements borne by many of these small \nfinancial institutions and free up scarce resources for their \ncommunities, enabling more individuals to find a home loan or get the \nfunding to start a business. And this does not increase financial risk.\n  A number of local credit unions have weighed in on the positive \nimpact our bill will have on increasing access to affordable mortgage \ncredit.\n  Additionally, had our bill's provisions on a rule called TRID--a 3-\nday waiting period--had they been in place in 2017, it would have \nhelped over 1.5 million credit union members at over 3,800 credit \nunions throughout the Nation, enabling them to take advantage of a \nlower interest rate and to avoid potential delays in the mortgage \norigination process. I will tell my colleagues, anybody who has had to \ngo through the mortgage origination process today knows the paperwork I \nam talking about.\n  Our bill also drastically simplifies the capital regime for certain \nhighly capitalized community banks compared to the current Basel III \nrequirements that are more appropriate for larger, sophisticated \nfinancial institutions.\n  Rebecca Romero Rainey, the former chairman and CEO of Centinel Bank \nof Taos and CEO-elect of the Community Bankers of America, made a \ncommonsense observation. She said:\n\n       Under Basel III, community bank capital regulation has \n     become significantly more punitive and complex. Do we really \n     need four definitions of regulatory capital, a capital \n     conservation buffer, and impossibly complex rules governing \n     capital deductions and adjustments?\n       Applying the rule to community banks in a one-size-fits-all \n     manner harms the consumers and businesses we serve.\n\n  She added:\n\n       I seriously doubt that my grandfather would have founded \n     Centinel if he had to comply with Basel III and the other new \n     regulations that exist today.\n\n  We want to encourage people to bank in their communities.\n  Dodd-Frank also dealt with midsized and regional banks, and our bill \ndoes too. Dodd-Frank swept many simple midsized and regional banks into \nits enhanced prudential standards, but it was meant for the largest and \nmost complex institutions. Each new regulation poses a tradeoff between \nhiring new employees to help comply with those standards versus \nemployees to provide customers the products and services they want and \nneed.\n  Deron Smithy, executive vice president and treasurer for Regions \nBank, a regional bank based in Alabama, described the implications of \nthis on his institution, saying, ``We now have more people in our \norganization devoted to compliance-related matters than we do for \ncommercial lending'' and that ``the direct cost, as well as \nmanagement's time and attention to meeting these rules, creates a \ndisproportionate burden on regional banks. Collectively, the \nincremental cost of regulatory compliance exceeds $2 billion \nannually.'' The $2 billion in costs that Mr. Smithy mentioned were just \nthe direct costs. Indirect costs include management and other business \nunits' time being diverted from fully serving their clients.\n  These are not just empty numbers; behind these numbers are real \neconomic consequences. That is a fact Mr. Smithy noted in his testimony \nbefore the Banking Committee.\n\n       For a company like Regions, that standard being lifted \n     would likely liberate as much as 10 percent additional \n     capacity for lending, which--\n\n  In his bank's case--\n\n     would be $8 billion to $10 billion.\n       That is capital and access that are not available to \n     individuals, families, and small businesses in this Nation. \n     That is one bank.\n\n  During another Banking Committee hearing, Robert Hill, CEO of South \nState Corporation, a midsized bank, noted that when their institution \ncrossed the $10 billion threshold, ``South State was impacted by over \n$20 million per year, a significant sum for a bank our size. What \nimpact does that have on our local communities? For us, that equates to \n300 jobs. Approximately 10 percent of our branches were closed, and \neven more jobs diverted away from lending to regulatory compliance.''\n  Section 401 of our bill raises the SIFI threshold for applying \nenhanced prudential standards from $50 billion to $250 billion--a level \nthat many, many financial experts have encouraged for years--and the \n$10 billion threshold for applying an annual, company-run stress test \nto midsized banks while maintaining important safeguards against risks \nto the U.S. financial system. This will free up valuable financial and \nhuman resources to help keep more branches open, increase lending to \nconsumers and small businesses, and lower the cost of borrowing for \nconsumers.\n  The bill also deals with housing policy. Our bill provides some \nimportant improvements to HUD programs, making them more effective and \nefficient and enabling public housing authorities across the country to \nbetter address the housing needs of their local community.\n  Our bill enhances HUD's Family Self-Sufficiency Program, which will \nenable a greater number of families currently assisted by HUD to obtain \njob training, education, childcare, and ultimately achieve financial \nindependence. Specifically, the bill would broaden the scope of \nsupportive services that can be offered to these participants, \nincluding home ownership assistance, training in asset management, \nobtaining a GED, and education in pursuit of a postsecondary degree or \ncertification. It would also streamline the administration of the \nprogram, making it easy for local public housing authorities to deliver \nit in their communities.\n\n\n  For the first time ever, our bill will enable many families who live \nin privately owned apartments backed by project-based rental assistance \nto also participate in the FSS Program.\n  Our bill would also provide targeted regulatory relief to small \npublic housing agencies operating in rural communities. While smaller \npublic housing authorities typically have far fewer staff and resources \nthan larger urban agencies, they, too, are currently held to many of \nthe same burdensome regulatory requirements as some of the largest ones \nin the country. As a result, this means that more of their time and \nmoney are spent completing paperwork and less are able to be dedicated \nto promoting access to affordable housing in these communities.\n  Our bill would provide tailored regulatory relief that recognizes the \nunique challenges faced by smaller public housing authorities in rural \nareas. Specifically, it would provide a simpler option for calculating \nutilities, simplify environmental review requirements for new \ndevelopments, streamline inspection requirements, and make it easier to \ncoordinate efforts, such as enabling shared waiting lists with \nneighboring agencies and enabling neighboring agencies to pool their \nresources to develop larger projects.\n  These changes will set up these small agencies for success and enable \nthem to direct a greater amount of time, effort, and resources toward \ntheir core mission: promoting access to affordable housing.\n  The bill is also a consumer protection bill. It ensures that key \nconsumer protections remain in place and increases protections for \nconsumers who have fallen on hard financial times or become victims of \nfraud.\n  Following the Equifax data breach, we held two credit bureau \nhearings. These hearings demonstrated bipartisan support for some \nimportant measures. The bill provides 1 free year of fraud alerts for \nconsumers potentially impacted by the Equifax breach or other instances \nof fraud. It gives consumers unlimited free credit freezes and \nunfreezes during the year. It allows parents to turn on and off credit \nreporting for children under 16.\n  The bill also includes important protections for veterans and senior \ncitizens. The Department of Veterans Affairs Choice Program provides \nveterans non-VA medical care if they can't access care at a VA medical \nfacility. Unfortunately, the VA Choice Program has been rife with \nissues, including delayed payments and misassigned medical bills to \nveterans. As a result, veterans have experienced negative credit items \non their reports, which unnecessarily complicates their and their \nfamilies' lives.\n  The largest credit reporting agencies took a step to alleviate this \nproblem by delaying reporting medical debt on a consumer's credit \nreport for 180 days, but more can still be done. Our bill goes a step \nfurther by prohibiting medical debt arising from the Choice Program and \nother non-VA healthcare providers from being reported to credit-\nreporting agencies for 1 year and provides veterans a process to \ndispute or remove incorrect information already on their reports.\n  According to a study conducted by MetLife, seniors lose at least $2.9 \nbillion annually in reported cases of financial exploitation. Despite \nthe prevalence of senior financial fraud, the National Adult Protective \nServices Association estimated that only 1 in 44 cases of financial \nabuse is ever reported.\n  Current bank privacy laws make it difficult for the financial \ninstitutions and their employees to report any potential fraudulent \nactivity without incurring legal liability, and as a result, few cases \nof financial abuse are reported. Our bill would give financial advisers \ncivil liability protection when reporting suspected financial abuse of \nseniors. This will empower and encourage our financial service \nrepresentatives to identify warning signs of common scams and help stop \nfinancial fraud targeting our seniors.\n  Now I wish to turn for just a moment--I have gone over some of the \npositive benefits and provisions in this bill. I would like to turn for \na moment to the criticisms, because, if my colleagues have been \nlistening to the attacks, the attacks are that this is an effort to go \nhelp the big banks in America get richer at the expense of poor people. \nThis is a very common type of attack on almost any proposal to fix a \nregulation in the financial system.\n  One of the things we have heard is that it gives the regulators too \nmuch flexibility to tailor regulations to the size of the institution \nbeing regulated. This bill carefully balances the need to provide \nregulators with the appropriate discretion at the technical level, \nwhile imposing specific directions to ensure appropriate tailoring for \nMain Street banks and maintaining core supervisory tools for the \nlargest banks.\n  Regulators will still be required to ensure that banks operate in a \nsafe and sound manner and still retain extensive authorities to do so.\n  The bill also requires regulators to do more to tailor regulations to \nensure that the level of regulation and scrutiny of banks reflects the \npotential risks posed by the institutions--something that folks in my \nState would say is just common sense.\n  In the face of all of this, we have talked to a lot of the regulators \nthemselves to see what they think of the idea, and they are \nconsistently saying: Let us have the flexibility to regulate \nappropriately, and we will do the job. We will ensure that we have \nsafety and soundness, and we will ensure that we are not putting undue \nregulatory burdens on our financial institutions, particularly the \nsmallest ones.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said:\n\n       You know, we really want the most stringent things to be \n     happening at the systemically important banks--the most \n     stringent stress tests, in particular--and we want to tailor \n     or taper, as we go down into less significant, less \n     systemically important institutions.\n\n  Powell added: ``Those banks [below $100 billion] are not systemically \nimportant.\n  What he meant by that is they don't present systemic risks to the \neconomy. We should analyze them and regulate them and supervise them in \na more appropriate fashion.\n  Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randy Quarles has also \nnoted the importance of tailoring, saying:\n\n       One of the important general themes of regulation is \n     ensuring that the character of the regulation is adapted to \n     the character of the institution being regulated, what has \n     become the word ``tailoring.''\n       I fully support that, and I think that it's not only \n     appropriate to recognize the different levels of risk, and \n     types of risk that different institutions in the system pose, \n     but that it also makes for better and more efficient \n     regulation, and efficient regulation allows the financial \n     system to more efficiently support the real economy.\n\n  That is what we are talking about here.\n\n       So I do think that we should look very carefully . . . at \n     tailoring capital regulation and other types of regulation to \n     the particular character of the institutions that are \n     regulated, and that includes their size, and that includes \n     other aspects of the character.\n\n  Another critique I have heard is that the bill erodes the power of \nstress testing as a supervisory tool. In one way or another, many have \nstood on this floor and talked about the need to have this kind of \nflexibility, and others have stood on this floor and said it creates a \nhuge threat to our economy.\n  We have a hearing each year called the Humphrey-Hawkins hearing when \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve comes and testifies to the Senate \nand then to the House. This year, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \ncame before the Senate. To ensure that people and Members understood \nwhat this bill does, I asked Chairman Jay Powell: If this bill were to \npass, is it accurate that the Federal Reserve would still be required \nto conduct a supervisory stress test for any bank with total assets \nbetween $100 billion and $250 billion to ensure that it has enough \ncapital to weather economic downturns?\n  He replied: Yes, it is.\n  I asked: Is it accurate that the bill's change of the threshold from \n$50 billion to $250 billion for enhanced prudential standards does not \nweaken oversight of the largest, globally systemic banks?\n  He said: That is correct.\n  The Dodd-Frank Act established a $50 billion asset threshold to apply \nenhanced prudential standards to banks. Applying enhanced standards \nbroadly to regional banks with simple business models and low-risk \nprofiles has had significant consequences in the marketplace. Although \nthere has been much debate about the appropriate\n\n\nlevel for the threshold, there is bipartisan agreement that $50 billion \nis too low, including among Federal Reserve Chairman Powell, former \nFederal Reserve Bank Chairman Yellen, former Acting Comptroller \nNoreika, and former Comptroller Curry.\n  Current Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said: ``Our view has been \nthat that combination of raising the threshold and giving us the \nability to go below it in cases where needed gives us the tools that we \nneed.''\n  Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has said:\n\n       We've already said that we would favor some increase, if \n     Congress sticks with a dollar threshold--that we would \n     support some increase in the threshold. An approach based on \n     business model or factors is also a workable approach from \n     our point of view. Conceivably, some of the enhanced \n     standards should apply to more firms with lower levels of \n     assets, and others with higher levels. So I think either type \n     of approach is something that we could--we could work with \n     and would be supportive of.\n\n  That is the former Chair of the Federal Reserve.\n  Our bill rightsizes regulations by raising the $50 billion threshold \nto $250 billion. Banks with total assets below $100 billion are exempt \nimmediately from these enhanced standards, while those with between \n$100 billion and $250 billion are presumed exempt 18 months after the \nbill is enacted unless the Federal Reserve Board determines that they \nneed to have some additional level of standard applied, and the Federal \nReserve is given full authority to do so. The provision allows the \nFederal Reserve to tailor regulations to a bank's business model and \nrisk profile.\n  This provision in no way diminishes the effectiveness of prudential \nregulations, and it provides the Federal Reserve sufficient regulatory \nand supervisory discretion to apply these enhanced standards on any \nfirm it deems a threat to systemic risk or safety and soundness.\n  Let me restate that. If you have heard any of the attacks, you have \nheard that the Federal Reserve will not be able to adequately regulate \nthe banks anymore. The past two Chairmen of the Federal Reserve have \nsaid that is not correct, but the bill itself provides that the Federal \nReserve continues to have the authority to apply enhanced standards on \nany firm it deems a threat to systemic risk or safety and soundness.\n  So, again, for those who are attacking the bill, I think their \narguments are unfounded and, frankly, based in an effort to try to \ncreate concern about a risk that does not exist.\n  This provision also requires the Federal Reserve to apply a periodic \nsupervisory stress test to banks with between $100 billion and $200 \nbillion in assets, something that is often overlooked by those \ncommenting on the bill.\n  I have tried to go over some of the positive aspects of this bill and \nexplain why its title is Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and \nConsumer Protection Act and respond to some of the false, unfounded \nattacks on this bill.\n  This bill does not create any increased risk at the level of \nsupervision for the megabanks, those that were intended to be the \ntarget of Dodd-Frank when it was adopted, but it does provide increased \nsupport for those community banks and credit unions, and those regional \nbanks and midsized banks that are being so badly hurt and whose \ncustomers are being so deprived of needed and justified access to \ncredit and capital. That is what this debate is about.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation as we \nmove forward and help us bring economic growth, regulatory relief, and \nconsumer protection to all Americans."], "The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rutherford)": ["2018-05-16", "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rutherford).

What this legislation does is to say, look, \nlet's finish this entire process before we move that expense to the \nindustry, because when you put it to the industry and they are \nincurring this cost that could end up being an unnecessary cost, what \nhappens? Brick costs more. Building materials cost more.\n  Who ends up paying for that? Consumers, purchasers, individuals who \nare buying homes, individuals who are remodeling homes, individuals who \nare building commercial buildings.\n  So what we are saying is let's exercise some wisdom. Let's exercise a \nlittle bit of experience that comes from having been here before, and \nlet's delay until this entire process is finished.\n  As we have talked about bricks, we are also addressing the wood \nheater industry, which is a primary source of heat for many of our \nhomes, and just saying let's be mindful, let's be careful, let's put \nconsumers and taxpayers in front of the bureaucrats who are looking to \nimplement these rules and regulations."], "The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mitchell)": ["2018-03-08", "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mitchell).

I hope that all Federal agencies are \nhelping in whatever ways they can with Hawaii's natural disaster.\n  I also thank her for talking about the importance of net neutrality. \nI, too, have come to the floor to defend the open internet. It is a \npro-consumer, pro-innovation rule that we have to build on because it \nis worth 7 percent of our GDP and 6.9 million jobs. That is what the \ninternet economy is.\n\n  The net neutrality rules that we are fighting for today have four \nbright-line rules that help businesses, help consumers, and help our \ninternet economy to grow. They are these: No. 1, don't block content; \nNo. 2, don't throttle content--that is, don't slow it down--and No. 3, \ndon't create paid prioritization, which is like in the Burger King ad \nsaying: If you want the next Whopper available, pay $15. I think they \ndid a pretty good job of showing what would happen if you had every \nbusiness operating that way. No. 4 is transparency, to make sure that \nyou know exactly what you are getting charged for.\n  The Obama-era Federal Communications Commission adopted rules that \nbasically protected consumers and businesses on those four things. Why \ndid they do that? Because there were some who were trying to eke their \nway into making more money off of consumers and businesses on what is \nbasic service.\n  Title II was the regulatory framework that the Obama-era FCC used to \nmake sure that consumers were protected. They were the strongest tools \navailable, and they helped to make sure that there was not monopolistic \nbehavior that would harm businesses.\n  The rule that was established by the then-Federal Communications \nCommission was an open internet with the FCC being the cop on the beat. \nThat is to say, if you have these rules, you also have to have someone \nwho is going to enforce them, someone who is going to look at the \nmonopolistic behaviors of cable companies or providers and say: That is \nunfair to consumers and businesses.\n  But under the Trump-era FCC, all of those rules were thrown out. That \nis why we are here today. I and my colleagues are saying that we want \nto go back to the protections of the internet that are called ``net \nneutrality'' to make sure that the FCC--instead of a passive entity \nthat just OKs every charge that cable companies want to do--says: These \nare rules about not slowing down content, not engaging in\n\n\nmonopolistic behavior. These things are wrong, and we are going to be \nthe policeman on the beat.\n  The FCC can protect consumers and innovators, and they can make sure \nthat internet traffic does not violate an open internet. But, as I \nsaid, the Trump-era FCC is trying to throw out these strong rules, and \ncable companies are already--already--starting to raise prices for \nhigher speed.\n  In Vancouver, WA, Comcast recently announced that higher speed tiers \nwould be available but only to consumers who purchase expensive paid \nTV-internet bundles. That is why we are here. Because while it sounds \nlike: Why do we want to give cable companies the opportunity to \nthrottle, block, or create paid prioritization, we also have to realize \nthat today the internet economy is so much bigger than it has ever \nbeen; that it is a job creator and an innovator. In my State, it is 13 \npercent of our economy, and thousands of jobs that continue to grow \nevery day as new applications for the internet are created.\n  It is so important that businesses, which are even using these apps \nto help run their businesses more efficiently, continue to get access \nto those tools. But what about an internet in which a cable provider \ndecided to artificially slow down that website and thereby create a \ndisincentive for the very things that are helping to make our \nbusinesses more efficient?\n  So we want to make sure that the FCC does its original job. What is \nthat? Well, they are there to promote development and adaptation of \ncommunication networks in the public interest. They are serving \nconsumers, and that is the center of their mission.\n  The center of their mission should not be serving cable companies. \nThat is why courts have said to the FCC: If you want to have the \nauthority to protect an open internet, you have to do that under title \nII. Basically, the court explained that if enforcing open internet \nprinciples and being a watchdog against abuses is important to the \nFCC's mission of promoting the deployment and adoption of \ncommunications in the public interest, then, those powers have to flow \nfrom title II of the Communications Act. So that is why the Obama-era \nFCC adopted those rules.\n  Today we know that the internet is a basic necessity. It provides \naccess that helps our healthcare delivery system work, our education \nsystem work, our banking system work, shopping, and all sorts of things \nthat make it a necessary tool in life today.\n  When a service is that essential and critical to individuals and \ncommunities and their economic success, we need to make sure that \nconsumers have protections and to make sure that it is not abused.\n  In the United States, just three providers of internet access have \nabout 70 percent of consumers. In any market with only a few players, \nit is essential that we protect businesses and consumers, and that is \nexactly what title II does. It helps to protect us from a cable company \ngouging and its close cousin--paid prioritization.\n  Title II makes sure that the barriers to entry are not erected so \nthat entrepreneurs or startups that want to bring new products to \nmarket aren't artificially slowed down and a larger competitor that can \npay more for it can continue the access.\n  Just recently, we had an event with Redfin, a company that is \nchanging the real estate market in the Pacific Northwest by helping to \ndrive down the cost to consumers for real estate purchases. They made \nit very clear that Redfin was able to develop today because it had an \nopen internet and its consumers and business partners could connect to \nit. But in a world where they were just starting out new and they had \nto pay for prioritization to get good broadband service, they may not \nhave been as successful.\n  These rules--title II--give expert agencies the tools to look behind \nthe curtain and make sure that cable companies are providing the \nservices that do not violate an open internet.\n  There is a reason that cable companies don't want to follow these \nrules. It is because they want to make more money. I get it. They want \nto make more money. But I would say that with 40 percent of Americans \nhaving no choice in whom they buy internet services from, we have to be \nmuch more vigilant. These companies have several vertically integrated \ncompanies at the top, and they are seeking to amass more and more \ncontent. That could give them the tools, again, to block content, to \nslow it down, or to x out a competitor if they so choose. I do not want \nto see the FCC sitting on the sidelines and not policing this kind of \nenvironment.\n  I know that AT&T is now trying to merge with Time Warner. These large \ncompanies want to continue to amass content and to drive the \nmarketplace. The American Consumer Satisfaction Index tracks consumer \nsatisfaction, and these big companies are at an all-time low. Do \nconsumers think they are going to do the right thing on their own? Do \nthey think cable companies will do that?\n  The cable industry ranks at the very bottom of 43 industries in \nconsumer satisfaction. In fact, it has been in the dead-last position \nfor 5 years. So does the public think they are doing the right things \nwhen it comes to them or their businesses? I think that survey says it \nall. They have great concern.\n  One of the reasons cable companies give for why they don't want to \nfollow net neutrality rules is because they say it will hurt their \ninvestment in networks. Well, I guess I would ask the question: Did the \nObama-era FCC rules slow down investment? No, they didn't. The big \ncable companies continued to make investments in their networks.\n  In the year immediately following the FCC rule that went into place, \nthe entire industry showed that the total capital expenditures \nincreased by more than $550 million above the previous year's \ninvestment. For example, in a 2017 earnings report, Comcast, the \nNation's largest broadband provider, noted that its capital \nexpenditures increased 7.5 percent to $9 billion and that it continued \nto make deployment in platforms like X1 and wireless gateways.\n  Likewise, AT&T spent $22 billion on capital investments, up $20 \nbillion from the previous year.\n  In fact, 2016 represents the industry's highest single-year jump in \nbroadband network investment since 1999.\n  So the notion that they are somehow going to slow down on investment \nis just not true. The historic growth came after companies had a full \nyear to digest the impacts of title II and net neutrality rules being \nput in place by the Obama-era FCC.\n  So where are we today? Well, these companies continue to make money, \nand they want a free pass on continuing to make more. That is why our \ngoal is not the profits of big cable companies. Our goal is to make \nsure that the internet economy continues to grow and the juggernaut of \njob creation and innovation continues to expand.\n  We want the internet ecosystem that has doubled as a percentage of \nGDP from 2007 to 2017 to continue to grow. As I said, in my State it is \nabout 13 percent of our State's economy, and I spend practically every \nday in the Senate hearing about another innovation from someone in my \nState. It might be the farm economy and more efficient ways to produce \nproducts or get products to market or manage their livestock. It might \nbe in telemedicine and helping someone from one side of the State to \nthe other to get access to care. It might be as basic as connecting \npeople to their families and loved ones, but it is the internet that we \nknow today that is so integral to our lives.\n  I hope the commonsense legislation in front of us--the CRA--which \nwould restore those Obama-era FCC net neutrality rules, passes. I hope \nour colleagues will understand that getting exorbitant internet fees \nfrom cable providers is not the direction the American people want to \ngo. American entrepreneurs, innovators, and consumers cannot afford to \ntake that hit.

Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Crapo and my \ngood friend from Kansas, whose statement is so similar to mine in many \nways.\n  In rural Indiana--you talked about relationship banking. That is, in \nmany ways, the heartbeat of a community. Our small businesses, our \nfarms that are handed down from generation to generation--you find the \ngrandsons of our farmers dealing with the grandsons of the person who \ndeveloped the bank. It is a privilege to be part of this.\n  I thank the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Crapo, for \nleading this debate and for his good-faith efforts to make this a \nbipartisan process.\n  As we debate the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer \nProtection Act, the Senate is on the verge of doing something \nsignificant. We are breaking through the gridlock on a bipartisan \nlegislative package to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens on Main \nStreet banks and credit unions, while also expanding protections for \nconsumers, servicemembers, and veterans.\n  This is an example of what we can achieve when we work together. I am \nproud to have worked closely with my friend the chairman, Senator \nCrapo, among others, to craft this bipartisan legislation that, as my \nfriend Senator Tester mentioned--13 Republicans, 12 Democrats, 1 \nIndependent.\n  I have worked on this issue since I came to the Senate in 2013. This \nbill is\n\n\nthe result of dozens of meetings, Banking Committee hearings, and a \n7\\1/2\\-hour committee markup, where more than 100 amendments from both \nsides were filed, and 36 were considered and voted on. This bill is \ncarefully written and narrowly tailored.\n  This commonsense legislation is intended to help Main Street \ncommunity banks and local credit unions to focus more on traditional \nbanking--our small businesses, our farms, our families--while \nmaintaining the safety and soundness of our financial system.\n  In rural areas and in many towns across my beloved home State of \nIndiana, Main Street community banks and credit unions are the \ninstitutions that Hoosiers turn to--whether it is a family seeking a \nmortgage for their first home to make their dreams come true or an \nentrepreneur with a dream who is looking to start a small business, \ncreate more jobs, and make his or her community grow.\n  Unfortunately, the 103 community banks and 154 credit unions in \nIndiana have been unintentionally burdened by rules and regulations \nthat were intended to hold Wall Street accountable, to make sure they \nwould never damage our economy again. Since 2008, the number of small \nbusiness loans is down 41 percent nationally. That is according to our \nFederal banking regulators.\n  This package includes a number of important new consumer protections \nas well, including for servicemembers, as I mentioned, for veterans, \nseniors, and tenants.\n  One provision is based on my bipartisan Protecting Veterans Credit \nAct. It ensures that veterans are not wrongly penalized when the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs is late in paying a vet's medical bills.\n  In response to Equifax's massive data breach and other data breaches, \nfor the first time, every American--let me repeat that--every American \nwould be able to freeze and unfreeze their credit free of charge and \nset year-long fraud alerts.\n  This bill also provides free credit monitoring for all Active-Duty \nservicemembers.\n  This makes a big difference. It helps folks like Cpl Logan Hartz, a \nHoosier, who serves proudly in the U.S. Marine Corps. He was training \nat Camp Lejeune when he learned his personal information may have been \ncompromised by Equifax. He said it was really stressful to try to \nfigure out what to do and challenging to get his credit frozen. \nCorporal Hartz says the free credit monitoring in this bill would \nprovide peace of mind to servicemembers like him whose first focus is \non protecting our country.\n  I also want to highlight another provision I authored on manufactured \nhousing, which serves as a vital source of affordable housing not only \nin Indiana but across our country, particularly in rural and \nunderserved communities. This effort provides a narrow exemption to \nallow consumers to receive general financing information from a \nmanufacturer, while creating new disclosures to prevent conflicts of \ninterest and prohibiting retailers from directly advising consumers on \nfinancial transactions.\n  This legislation has broad bipartisan support, it maintains strong \nfinancial oversight, and it adds new consumer protections. It is \nreasonable, it is balanced, and it is the result of very thoughtful \nnegotiation and hard work. I am very hopeful it will pass the Senate \nsoon.\n  Again, I thank our chairman, Senator Crapo, for his bipartisan work, \nfor his willingness to be flexible, to stay with it when it looked so \ndifficult to get done. As a result, there are families who are going to \nbe in homes for the first time from loans they were able to get from a \nbanker who knew them in town, who, when every computer program showed \nsomething different, they knew the family was worth investing in. That \nis what this bill is going to do.\n  I very much thank the chairman."], "The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford)": ["2018-02-26", "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?"], "Mr. HEINRICH": ["2018-02-27", "  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my \ncolleague, Senator Collins of Maine, for her work in crafting this \nlegislation and the language of this bill and, more generally, for her \nleadership, formerly on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and certainly for the time that I have been on the \nIntelligence Committee. Her contributions have not gone unnoticed, and \nshe has been a pleasure to work with in trying to find reasonable \nplaces where we can make a material difference in the kinds of mass \nshootings we have seen.\n  I should start by speaking a little bit to the recent tragedy in \nFlorida. As the father of two young boys, I can't begin to imagine the \nnightmare that families are living through as they mourn the loss of \ntheir children in the wake of yet another horrific mass shooting.\n  Frankly, no parent should have to live in fear of their child not \ncoming home from school. It is pretty unthinkable.\n  Just last week, one of my own sons went through an active shooter \ntraining at his school. Sadly, that is now the new norm in schools all \nacross our country. In fact, 91 Americans are killed each day by gun \nviolence, and we simply cannot accept the status quo as the new normal \nwhen there are real\n\n\nand concrete steps we can take to reduce gun violence while respecting \nconstitutional rights.\n  Once again, Americans are looking to Congress to finally enact \ncommonsense reforms to our gun laws, to protect our schools, to protect \nour children, to protect our communities. Like so many Americans, I \nhave been deeply moved by the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School \nstudents and young people all across this country who have spoken out \nafter losing classmates and friends to demand that we as lawmakers take \naction to prevent future tragedies.\n  It is no secret to my constituents or even my colleagues here that I \nam a passionate outdoorsman, hunter, and owner of firearms. I strongly \nbelieve that law-abiding Americans have a right to own guns for sport \nand self-defense. I am teaching my own sons how to safely and \nresponsibly use those firearms. The vast majority of Americans, \nincluding gun owners like me, know that Congress must take action to \nclose loopholes and reform our laws to keep those deadly weapons out of \nthe hands of those who would turn them against our communities.\n  Today I am quite proud to join my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle--Senators Collins, Heitkamp, Flake, and others--to introduce one \nof those measures that should have broad bipartisan support. This is a \nposter child for the kind of policy that ought to get across the finish \nline even in these deeply divided, partisan times.\n  Our bipartisan legislation, the Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act, \nwould deny firearms sales to individuals who appear on the Department \nof Justice's no-fly or selectee lists. These are the narrowest of \ndatabases, the kinds of lists one would have to work pretty hard to \nland on, and for good reason. Our legislation includes due process \nprocedures for individuals to appeal their placement on those lists.\n  It seems pretty straightforward to most of my constituents that if \nthe government and law enforcement have determined that an individual \nis so dangerous as to land on the terrorist watch list and is too \ndangerous to fly on a commercial airplane, that person should not be \nable to walk into a gun shop and purchase a gun. But unless we pass \nthis legislation, this glaring loophole will continue to allow \nindividuals identified as terror suspects to buy firearms.\n  It is time for those Members of Congress who oppose commonsense \nreforms like this to finally step up and tell us what they are doing to \nprotect the public. It is time for all of us to listen to the student \nleaders across this country who are rejecting the unacceptable status \nquo of our Nation's gun violence epidemic.\n  Those of us in the Senate who know firearms well have a special duty \nto lead these efforts and to get the details right on any legislation \nto reshape our Nation's gun laws. Inaction simply won't cut it anymore. \nWe all need to listen to these students, parents, teachers, and to our \nown children who are calling on us to be part of the solution.\n  New Mexicans can count on me, despite the odds, to continue fighting \nfor real solutions to keep our children safe, to reduce gun violence, \nand to keep our communities safe. That is what our communities and our \nconstituents deserve.\n  Thank you."], "Mr. SCHATZ": ["2018-04-25", "  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, in his confirmation hearing last January, \nEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said there was evidence that climate \nchange had actually leveled off over the past two decades.\n  In response to Mr. Pruitt's comments, an atmospheric scientist in \nCalifornia named Benjamin Santer pulled together some colleagues to \nstudy satellite data from around the world. They found that Mr. Pruitt \nwas in fact wrong, and they prepared to publish their findings in \nNature Scientific Reports.\n  Then something pretty weird happened. A few of the scientists came \nforward and said that they didn't want their names listed on the \nresearch. They were worried about their ability to get a green card in \nthe United States. Mr. Santer told the New Yorker that this was the \nfirst time in his life that he had seen his colleagues fear putting \ntheir names on research because they were worried about the negative \nconsequences for themselves and their families.\n  In this country, scientists should not work in fear. They should not \nworry about their work being politicized. But this is where we are, and \nit is a moment that has been carefully planned by a small group of \npeople who do not want the United States to act on climate. Because of \nthese groups, the United States is home to the only major political \nparty that opposes climate action. Because of these groups, Scott \nPruitt--a man who denies that climate change is real and that it is \ncaused by humans--is running the Federal Agency charged with dealing \nwith climate change.\n  For too long, these groups have gone unchallenged, their web of \ndeceit untouched. So I am joining with my colleagues to shine a light \non these groups and how they have warped our ability to make good \nchoices.\n  The Heartland Institute was started in 1984, ostensibly by a group of \nLibertarians. Each of their positions boils down to the idea that the \ngovernment has no role--not to work on ending tobacco use or to define \nwhat health insurance should look like. But they are especially focused \non keeping the government from doing anything about climate change.\n  The Heartland Institute denies that climate change is happening, and \nI disagree with them. Ninety-seven percent of all climate scientists \ndisagree with them. But they are not playing by the average think tank \nrules because they are not your normal think tank. Over the years, the \nHeartland Institute has gained a reputation for, as one website put it, \nbeing a mouthpiece for the corporations who fund it, and their funders \nare very, very hard to track because Heartland keeps its donations \nsecret. But we know that donors like the Koch brothers, ExxonMobil, and \nthe Mercers are some of Heartland's biggest funders, and these donors \njust so happen to benefit from American inaction on climate.\n  If the government does what Heartland wants and stops protecting the \nenvironment, these people will profit. It is almost as if the Heartland \nInstitute exists to promote the interests of its donors.\n  Last year, they mailed a package to hundreds of thousands of science \nteachers. It had pamphlets, a DVD, and a book called ``Why Scientists \nDisagree about Global Warming.'' The mass mailing was an effort to \ndisseminate fossil fuel industry talking points as curriculum for \nscience teachers. They tried to send it to every middle school, high \nschool, and college teacher in the country.\n  The institute has also done everything it can to defend Mr. Pruitt, \nwho is being investigated for a historic number of ethical lapses. \nHeartland wrote a letter to the White House just recently that called \non the President to continue supporting Mr. Pruitt. The letter said the \n10 ethical investigations into Mr. Pruitt amount to ``an orchestrated \npolitical campaign by [the President's] enemies.''\n  Heartland also supports a new proposed EPA rule, and--get this one--\nit is a new EPA rule that will restrict the use of scientific studies \nin EPA decision making. It will restrict the use of science in EPA \ndecision making.\n  The American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American \nChemical Society, the American Lung Association, and the National \nCouncil for Science and the Environment are some of the 50 science \norganizations and higher education institutions that have opposed the \nnew rule. But the Heartland Institute is for this rule.\n  I want to be really clear about this. This isn't about someone having \na conservative ideology or different view from mine about what our \nenergy future ought to be. There is no leftwing equivalent of the \ninstitute that acts like this. Brookings, the Center for American \nProgress, and other left-leaning think tanks all have dissent within \ntheir ranks, and even on the right, AEI and many others have legitimate \nacademic discussions within the context of their political philosophy. \nThat is not what this is. These other think tanks do not ignore \nscientific facts because they are real think tanks. But Heartland is \nnot a think tank in any true sense of the word. Their work is focused \nnot on promoting analysis based on science but on trashing analysis \nbased on science. If you don't know that, then you can easily think \nthey are legitimate.\n  For example, the Heartland Institute sends a monthly newsletter about \nclimate issues to every legislator in the country--State and Federal. \nIt is actually a pretty good-looking product. This is a copy of it. It \nis actually really well done and well laid out in color, so it is not \nimmediately obvious that this isn't even analysis. It looks like a \npublication from a scientific institution.\n  The people they quote or rely on for data are almost always from \nindustry-supported think tanks funded by the same people. This month, \nthey highlighted one of their own policy analysts who said that \nOklahoma should not subsidize wind power because the industry can't \nsurvive without subsidies. They claim that wind energy is far less \nreliable and far more expensive than the power derived from fossil \nfuel. Who benefits from that analysis?\n  The fact is that wind energy is now the largest source of reliable \nelectricity-generating capacity in the United States. In Oklahoma alone \nat least 30 percent of all power consumption comes from wind farms, and \nsubsidies for fossil fuels are 40 times those for clean energy.\n  Also in their April newsletter, Heartland claims that natural gas has \nlittle effect on global temperatures. But recent evidence shows that \nmethane emissions from oil and gas are vastly undercounted.\n  The temperature data on the back cover of this newsletter is from a \nclimate denier at the University of Alabama whose data is considered \nunreliable and biased by the vast majority of the scientific community. \nThis is not normal intellectual dissent within the scientific \ncommunity. This is not normal political dissent about what our energy \nfuture should be. These people are propagating propaganda. This is not \nthe work of a legitimate think tank. A legitimate think tank does not \nignore facts and evidence. It does not publish data from a climate \ndenier who is known in the science community for publishing work loaded \nwith errors.\n  They are pushing us away from science and from doing the hard work of \nprotecting and preserving our country's clean air and water so that a \nfew of their donors can continue to make as much money as possible.\n  I was pleased with President Macron's speech today. There was so much \nhe reminded us that we had in common, not just between America and \nFrance but between Democrats and Republicans. As he reminded us of our \ngreat history together, as he reminded us of our cultural exchange, as \nhe reminded us of our military cooperation, he also reminded us that \nour great democracies believe in science. We have to believe in \nscience. We have to believe in expertise. It is absolutely appropriate.\n  The Presiding Officer and I do not share the same political \nphilosophy, but we have to share the same set of facts. That is what is \nso damaging about a so-called think tank like Heartland. They are not \nlike AEI; they are not like CAP; they are not like Brookings. They are \nnot like any other\n\n\nthink tank in Washington, DC, that on the level, from the standpoint of \ntheir own political philosophy and their own objectives, tries to get \nthe right answer. That is an absolutely appropriate function for an \ninstitution to serve in this city, but what these guys do is not that.\n  I think it is very important that we draw a distinction between those \nwho are relying upon facts and science, and those who are not. That is \nwhy I wanted to point out what Heartland is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Mr. GUTHRIE": ["2018-01-25", "  Mr. GUTHRIE.

The \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, is a civil rights law \npassed in 1990 to protect people with disabilities from discrimination \nin all aspects of society.\n  I recognize that the ADA falls within the committee jurisdiction of \nthe Judiciary Committee, and I am here as the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Education and the Workforce because, if H.R. 620 were to \nbecome law, it would have a profound effect on students and workers \nwith disabilities who are trying to learn, work, or just generally \naccess their community.\n  Mr. Chair, prior to the ADA, people with disabilities had no recourse \nif they faced discrimination in employment, housing, transportation, \nhealth services, or when accessing public schools. The ADA is nearly 28 \nyears old, and yet we still have continued gross noncompliance with the \nlaw.\n  H.R. 620 specifically targets title III of the ADA regarding access \nto public accommodations. Title III prohibits discrimination in public \naccommodations such as restaurants, shopping malls, and hotels. By \nadding a notice and cure requirement, H.R. 620 shifts the compliance \nburden to the victims of discrimination.\n  H.R. 620 effectively provides that discrimination against people with \ndisabilities can continue until somebody hires a lawyer to file a legal \ncomplaint of discrimination. Then the bill allows 6 more months to \nachieve some undefined substantial progress. So even when people know \nthey are out of compliance with the ADA, they don't have to do anything \nunder the bill until somebody files a formal legal complaint.\n  Mr. Chair, this bill does not help people with disabilities.

So the frustration comes because I know the pain \nassociated.\n  So when we start talking about the 2,200 people who were killed, that \nis 2,200 families that had to get up and hear the preacher say: Oh, \npain may endureth through the night, but joy cometh in the morning.\n  Well, joy is not going to come in the morning if the same thing keeps \nhappening and Congress will not do anything about it, because that \nmeans those lives were lost in vain, and that is just as big a sin, in \nmy estimation. I just think that we have to do something about it.\n  It is one thing when the cameras are there and the family has the \nsupport at the funeral of all these people, the Congressperson comes, \nfamily comes, and says, ``Oh, we are going to be with you, and we are \ngoing to support you and pray for you during this time,'' but at the \nend of the day, that mother and father goes back to that house, and \nthat kid's room is empty.\n  There are no words of comfort that we can give to that family when \nthey walk by that room every night and it is empty because we let \nsomebody with mental issues get their hands on an AR-15 and slaughter a \nbunch of kids in school. So if it sounds like I am upset, then you are \nright, because those parents shouldn't have to pass an empty room.\n  Every empty room that happens, my fear is that we are complicit by \nomission of letting it happen over and over again, and I don't want \nthat on my conscience.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n\n"], "Mr. LaMALFA": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this morning, I wish to commend Attorney \nGeneral Jeff Sessions and the Trump administration for finally taking \naction against California's lawlessness on sanctuary cities and \nimmigration practices.\n  California is clearly violating Federal immigration laws. States \ndon't get to dictate to the Federal Government when and where these \nlaws are enforced.\n  California needs to be held accountable for their willful defiance of \nFederal immigration law and its sanctuary State insurrection.\n  Several laws have been passed by the Federal Government over the \nyears on immigration. Actually enforcing a law on the books, arresting \nand deporting illegal immigrants shouldn't be shocking. The Supreme \nCourt has held that immigration regulation was a Federal responsibility \nexclusively in 1876.\n  Under the Obama administration, Arizona, in order to try to fix the \nimmigration problem in this country, passed a bill called S.B. 1070, \nbut the Supreme Court ruled that they couldn't enforce the border \nthemselves.\n  Now we have California going the other direction, trying to cause no \nenforcement to be done on immigration in our State. The Federal \nGovernment is ruling and working to overcome that as well.\n  So I commend Attorney General Sessions for taking action on \nCalifornia's lawlessness.\n"], "Mr. WOMACK": ["2018-04-24", "  Mr. WOMACK.

In 1950, at the age of 21, he \nwas admitted to the Georgia Bar after attending the Emory School of Law \nand graduating from the Woodrow Wilson Law School in Atlanta.\n  Emory Schwall has served as special assistant attorney general for \nthe State of Georgia representing the insurance commissioner. He is a \ncertified estate planner and mediator, a member of Atlanta Estate \nPlanning Council, the Atlanta Bar Association, the Georgia Bar \nAssociation, and the American Bar Association. He also is a member of \nthe Emory Law School Council.\n  As impressive as Emory Schwall's professional legal career has been, \nhis impact on one of Georgia's finest not-for-profit hospitals is \nprobably one of the areas of work of which he is most proud. The \nShepherd Center in Atlanta specializes in medical treatment, research, \nand rehabilitation for people with spinal cord injury, brain injury, \nmultiple sclerosis, spine and chronic pain, and other neuromuscular \nconditions. Founded in 1975, the Shepherd Center is ranked by U.S. News \n& World Report as among the top 10 rehabilitation hospitals in the \nNation, and it has grown from a six-bed rehabilitation unit to a world-\nrenowned, 152-bed hospital that treats more than 8,500 patients each \nyear.\n  Emory Schwall has been active with the Shepherd Center since its \ninception, helping it obtain grants and bequests, and he has led \ncapital campaigns and other initiatives that have helped its growth. He \nserved on the original board of directors for the Shepherd Center \nFoundation. He has also served as vice president and as a director of \nShepherd Center, Inc., from 1987 until 2017.\n  Emory Schwall has also served his church Trinity Presbyterian Church \nsince 1956, not only as a parishioner, but also as a deacon, an elder, \nand as chair of its finance committee.\n  An appreciation for the preservation of history led him, as president \nof the Atlanta Medical Heritage, to donate the Academy of Medicine \nbuilding, a designated historical landmark in Atlanta, to the Georgia \nTech Foundation to ensure funds for the restoration and preservation of \nthe building.\n  Further, Atlanta's Piedmont Hospital has benefitted from Emory \nSchwall's generosity and service, including serving as an active member \nof the Friends of Piedmont Hospital charitable arm.\n  Emory Schwall also is active with national charitable and civic \norganizations such as the American Heart Association and the Arthritis \nFoundation.\n  His dedication to service earned him the ``Greater Good Award'' from \nthe Georgia Planned Giving Council in 2009. This annual award is \npresented to an individual whose career is currently focused on \nadvising individuals, attorneys, financial planners, insurance \ncounselors, trust officers, accountants, and other financial advisers \nfor obtaining charitable contributions, and a ``Greater Good Award'' \nrecipient must have served to increase the quantity and quality of \nplanned gifts to charities in Georgia.\n  Emory Schwall is truly a great Georgian, and I am fortunate to call \nhim my friend. He, along with his wife, the late Peggy McCready \nSchwall, shared a love of service to others.

It would also restrict consumer \nchoice, as many currently available models may not be able to meet the \n2020 deadline. H.R. 1917 will not remove any regulations.

Mr. President, I would like to honor the memory of a \ndear mentor and friend, Elder Von G. Keetch, who passed away suddenly \non January 26 at the age of 57.\n  Elder Keetch was a brilliant attorney who used his gifts in the \nservice of God.\n  As chief outside counsel and public affairs director to the Church of \nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Elder Keetch had the immense \nresponsibility of representing his faith in the public square.\n  As an ardent supporter of religious freedom, he also had the \nprivilege of defending others' ability to worship according to the \ndictates of their conscience.\n  ``Religious liberty is a God-given right,'' Elder Keetch said. ``It \nis essential to all men and women exercising their agency and learning \nto choose between right and wrong.''\n  Elder Keetch had deep respect for our constitutional rights because \nof his profession, but as a man of faith, he knew that conversions of \nthe heart occur through personal encounters.\n  Mindful of this truth, Elder Keetch strove to imitate Jesus Christ in \nall aspects of his life. He encouraged his fellow Christians to do the \nsame, even during contentious public debates.\n  ``Ask yourself how you can best teach and defend the doctrine of the \ngospel of Jesus Christ while also showing love, kindness, and \nunderstanding,'' he wrote.\n  Elder Keetch was born in Provo and lived for much of his life in \nUtah.\n  He earned his bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University and his \nlaw degree from BYU's law school.\n  During this period, he clerked at the Supreme Court for Chief Justice \nWarren Burger and Justice Antonin Scalia, where he worked on pivotal \nreligious liberty cases such as Employment Division v. Speech, 1990.\n  As he came up through the ranks, Elder Keetch caught the attention of \nprominent legal minds, including my father, Rex Lee, who mentored him \nduring law school.\n  Years later, Elder Keetch would return the favor by mentoring another \nyoung BYU law student--me.\n  I still remember the enthusiasm that Elder Keetch brought to his \nclass on the First Amendment. He wanted to impress upon his students \nthe importance of these old court decisions to our lives.\n  At least in my case--and I am sure in countless others--he succeeded.\n  After Elder Keetch graduated from law school, he could have worked at \nhis choice of law firms in Washington, DC, or New York. Instead, after \nprayerful consideration, he returned to Utah to work at Kirton \nMcConkie, a law firm that works closely with the LDS Church.\n  Soon, Elder Keetch was an advocate in some of the highest profile \npublic debates of our time, defending religious liberty against \ncoercion and the institution of marriage against attempts to redefine \nit.\n  At the same time, Elder Keetch was called to positions of leadership \nwithin the LDS Church. He was sustained as a General Authority Seventy \nof the Church on April 4, 2015.\n  So tireless was Elder Keetch that, when he was called to a full-time \nposition in the LDS Church, two attorneys were assigned to take over \nhis work.\n  In spite of these important and time-consuming responsibilities, \nElder Keetch made family his first priority.\n  Elder Keetch is survived by six children and his wife, Bernice, who \nhas been his steady companion and sweetheart since she invited him to a \ndance in high school. His family surrounded him with love as he battled \ncancer, the illness that eventually took him away from us.\n  It is hard to grapple with the unexpected death of a mentor, father, \nhusband, and leader like Elder Von Keetch, but we should take heart \nfrom words that Elder Keetch himself spoke before a General Conference \naudience in 2015.\n  He said that trials were to be expected if we want to follow the One \nwho suffered for us on Calvary.\n  We represent the love and faith of Christ, Elder Keetch taught, ``in \nsituations where we don't fully understand the reason for God's \ncommand.''\n  I don't know why my dear friend and mentor was called home so soon, \nbut I can take inspiration from his spectacular life.\n  I still recall a phone conversation with Elder Keetch many years ago, \nwhen I was finishing a clerkship with then-Judge Samuel Alito.\n  Elder Keetch was by then a prominent attorney. By contrast, I was a \nkid fresh out of school looking for life advice.\n  Still, he took my call, listened with great care and attention, and \ngave wise counsel that served me well down the line. Undoubtedly, Elder \nKeetch's time could have been spent better elsewhere, yet he chose to \nspend it on me.\n  That is what I will remember about Elder Keetch. He brought the same \nenthusiasm to pivotal court cases and seemingly unimportant phone \nconversations.

Tragically, Deputy Pickett was killed in the \nline of duty on March 2, 2018.\n  Deputy Pickett, or ``Jake'' as he was known to his family and \nfriends, served in law enforcement for the last eight years. Jake made \nthe decision every day to put his life on the line to make Indiana a \nsafer place. A true Hoosier, Jake graduated from Brownsburg High School \nand then graduated from the Marion County Sheriffs Office Training \nAcademy in 2010. In 2014, he was a member of class 202 and completed \ntraining with the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy as a pistol expert.\n  Jake served with the Boone County Sheriff's Office for three years. \nBefore joining the Boone County Sheriff's Office, he served as a Deputy \nwith the Tipton County Sheriff Department. Jake also worked in the \nMarion County Jail. Although, I did not have the good fortune of \nknowing Deputy Pickett, I am incredibly proud of his heroic and brave \nactions to protect his fellow Hoosiers.\n  On March 2, Jake pinned on his badge and went to work on what he \nthought would be an ordinary day on the job. He was out on patrol, and \njoined officers from the Lebanon Police Department in pursuit of three \nsuspects. Deputy Pickett was on foot in pursuit of the suspects when he \nwas fatally shot. Jake laid down his life to protect his community from \na dangerous individual. His last moments demonstrate the bravery, \ncommitment, and sacrifice that he and his brothers and sisters in \nuniform display every day while working to make Indiana a safer and \nbetter state. Each and every day, officers like Jake put their lives in \nharm's way to protect us.\n  For the last two years, Jake led the Boone County Sheriff's \nDepartment K-9 team. His partner was Brik, a brown and black German \nshepherd-Belgian Malinois. They began working together in March 2016, \nand Brik rarely left Jake's side. On Tuesday, when Boone County Sheriff \nMike Nielsen and prosecutors held a news conference to announce charges \nagainst the man accused of fatally shooting Jake, Brik was there with \nSheriff Nielsen.\n  I join with Sheriff Nielsen and all of Boone County in mourning \nJake's loss. As Sheriff Nielsen said, ``There will forever be a loss \nfelt in our community for him. He was a warrior, and he died laying \ndown his life for you. He will never be forgotten.''\n  Day after day, Jake displayed the compassion and integrity of a true \npublic servant. In uniform, Jake would greet children at school. When \noff-duty, Jake spent time saving rescue animals. Jake's selflessness \nextended in death. He was an organ donor, and his heart saved the life \nof another patient at St. Vincent's Hospital in Indianapolis.\n  Jake and his wife, Jennifer, were married for ten years and have two \nyoung sons. Jake was a beloved husband and a devoted father. In \naddition to his wife and two sons, Jake is survived by his parents, \nMarlin and Rebecca Pickett; his sister Kristi Woo and niece Hannah Woo; \nhis parents-in-law, Jon and Carol Lindstrom; his brothers-in-law, \nJeremy Lindstrom and Christopher Lindstrom. Deputy Pickett is a hero.\n  Jake will be forever missed by his colleagues at the Boone County \nSheriff's office and by his family. The people of Indiana's Fifth \nCongressional District are eternally grateful for Jake's contributions \nto our Hoosier community and it is my privilege to honor him today. On \nbehalf of all Hoosiers, I would like to salute Deputy Jacob Pickett for \nhis impact and service to our community. His work with the Boone County \nSheriff's Department and the K-9 unit were unmatched, and his presence \nwill be greatly missed. I extend my deepest condolences to Jake's \nfamily, the Boone County Sheriff's Department, his friends, and the \nfellow officers who mourn his loss. My thoughts and prayers are with \nthem.\n"], "Mr. TROTT": ["2018-02-07", "  Mr. TROTT.

Is there objection to the request \nof the gentleman from Pennsylvania?"], "Ms. PELOSI": ["2018-01-18", "  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I \ncommend her for her great leadership as our ranking member on the \nAppropriations Committee--as we say, the almighty powerful \nAppropriations Committee on which I was proud to serve with the \ngentleman, Mr. Frelinghuysen, and Congresswoman Lowey.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed, though, that the legislation that is \nbrought to the floor today falls so very short of our responsibilities \nto the\n\n\nAmerican people. When it comes to considering this bill, which the \nRepublicans are bragging supports CHIP, it is important to review the \nfacts. The facts are these: the CHIP proposal that the Republicans \nboast was on the floor in October, this or that, was funded by taking \nmoney from other children's programs, and that is why it was not to be \nsupported by us. It is also important to remember that the CHIP \nreauthorization expired September 30.\n\n\n  So here we are with our fourth continuing resolution. That means, on \nSeptember 30, we were supposed to not only reauthorize CHIP but to pass \nan omnibus bill to fund the government. Republicans were not able to \nmake the decisions necessary to do that, so we had one extension, \nanother extension, another extension. This is the fourth extension.\n  Now, for somebody who doesn't know what a CR is, that is our \nWashington lingo. It is a continuing resolution. What it says is that \nthe funding for the country will be continued at the same rate as it \nwas in the previous year regardless of the fact that other challenges \nhave emerged.\n  So, by engaging in the failure to pass an omnibus bill and engage \ninstead in these short-term continuing resolutions, this inadequacy \ndoes not give certainty to our military. General Mattis has told us \nthat the military cannot go on these every-2-weeks, every-month CRs. We \nneed to know. We need to have an omnibus that recognizes the full \ncomplement of our needs, and they are different from last year.\n  It does not fund the fight against opioid addiction. We have talked \nabout this. We have authorized language. We have put up some money. But \nthroughout our country, there is an opioid epidemic that needs to be \naddressed with full funding for it--not just conversation or rhetoric, \nbut funding.\n  It does not address some of the crises facing our veterans, whether \nit is their infrastructure, housing, whatever, or additional funding \nthat is needed for our veterans over and above whatever it was last \nyear, and this ignores that need.\n  It ignores the fact that we have some issues that we have to address \nregarding endangered pensions in our country, which have a direct \nrelationship to the economic well-being of America's working families, \npensions paid into, pensions having a shortfall, to honor the \nresponsibility.\n  It doesn't protect the DREAMers. We could protect the DREAMers in all \nof this, but it is missing an opportunity.\n  This takes us right back to the CHIP. It does not fund community \nhealth centers that provide primary care for 27 million Americans.\n  So these priorities are bipartisan. Nothing I mentioned on this list \nis anything that does not have bipartisan support in the Congress, that \nhas not been openly discussed--bipartisanship, transparency, unity--\nunifying us around these issues. We did not put priorities forward that \nwere partisan, but those that had bipartisan--strong bipartisan--\nsupport.\n  So when our colleagues come to the floor and say, ``Oh, we are doing \nCHIP,'' CHIP is a wonderful initiative. It was one of the first bills \nthat I passed and sent to President Obama when I was Speaker of the \nHouse. This is of high value to all of us on both sides of the aisle, \nbut not high enough of a value to put it in its proper context. So this \nreauthorization of CHIP that they are putting here, this funding for \nCHIP is not really funding.\n  Let me just make a distinction. We wanted 10 years for CHIP, to make \nit permanent--so we don't have to go through this--and remove all \ndoubt, remove the uncertainty as to whether this healthcare would be \navailable to those children who need it. We said, 10 years, you save $6 \nbillion; $6 billion, you save. You do 6 years, as in this bill, you \nsave $1 billion. Why wouldn't we want to save $6 billion?\n  Nonetheless, my concern is that they chose to bring a bill to the \nfloor that isolates CHIP away from the other essentials that are a part \nof the delivery of that healthcare service to children. It does not \nreauthorize community health centers which provide, as I say, vital \ncare to 26 million Americans. It does not extend the Medicare extenders \nso necessary, especially for our seniors with home visiting care and \nother initiatives.\n  It does not address the Medicaid DSH, disproportionate share \nchallenge that is across America. Ask your friends in rural America, \nespecially, about that. Therapy services, diabetes, and teaching health \ncenters for primary care doctors, all are completely out of this bill.\n  That is why I am so proud of the legislation introduced by \nCongressman McEachin today which has the full complement. It is nothing \nadditional. It is how we have always proceeded with the priority of \nchildren's health in a package that is about family health and delivery \nof service.\n  As the President, himself, tweeted this morning: ``CHIP should be \npart of a long-term solution, not a 30-day or short-term extension.'' \nWe like it 10 years; they have it 6 years. But it shouldn't be in this \nbill because this bill is sort of a half-baked facade to make it look \nas if we are keeping government open.\n  We are keeping government debilitated by not addressing, coming to \nagreement on the omnibus bill that we know that we have to do that \naddresses the needs of our military, as it recognizes the security \nprovisions in the domestic bill that are about security, whether it is \nthe State Department, Veterans Affairs, homeland security, or \nantiterrorism activities of the Justice Department; and also, the fact \nthat the strength of our country is measured in many ways: certainly, \nour military, which we are very proud of, and the agencies I mentioned, \nbut also in the health, education, and well-being of the American \npeople.\n  So we are here. What does government do?\n  Government does transportation. How can you, if you are in the \nTransportation Department, make commitments when you are on a short \nfuse of--what is it?--2 weeks in December, now 4 weeks that they want \nto go forward.\n  Why don't we just settle it? Grow up. Take responsibility. Get this \ndone for the American people.\n  Nobody I know wants a shutdown of government--well, maybe except for \nthe President, who said, ``Our country needs a good shutdown.'' He said \nthat in May. I think with his experience as President now, he probably \nknows there is no such thing as a good shutdown. We don't want a \nshutdown.\n  By the way, if there is one, this would be the first time there would \nbe a shutdown in recent history that took place when one party had the \nWhite House, had the Senate, and had the House of Representatives, had \nfull responsibility for managing and for leveraging, for getting the \njob done to fund our country for another year with certainty. This has \n2-year provisions in what we are negotiating with the Republicans.\n  So, really, coming to the floor and hiding behind CHIP to hide the \nshortcomings and the lack of taking responsibility for our \nresponsibilities to the American people is really a sad thing. That is \nwhy Mr. McEachin's bill and our previous question, which had the full \ncomplement to make CHIP really work, was the way to go.\n  Sadly, although I object to the process of one short-term continuing \nresolution of last year instead of looking to the future for next \nyear--I disapprove of that process--the substance of this legislation \nmakes it totally unacceptable, and I urge a ``no'' vote."], "Mr. WITTMAN": ["2018-04-25", "  Mr. WITTMAN.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his hard work \non our committee and leadership as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking the gentleman from Minnesota \n(Mr. Emmer) for sponsoring this very important legislation. Banks and \ncredit unions of all sizes are drowning in a sea of paperwork. We hear \nabout it every day from lenders that appear before the Financial \nServices Committee. The reality is that, because of the regulatory \nenvironment, mortgage lending is simply too burdensome for some \ncommunity banks and credit unions. Lenders have little choice but to \nlimit the products and services made available to customers or, in some \ncases, exit the mortgage business all together, which some have \nactually done.\n  The changes we have seen on the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act \nrequirements are a great example of regulation run amuck. On every \nloan, lenders must check a lengthy series of boxes. One mistake lands a \nbank or credit union out of compliance, in hot water with the field \nexaminers, and potentially exposed to litigation.\n  In committee, I had a matrix. It is almost 300 boxes of things that \nthey have to look at. Then if there is one box that is out of \ncompliance, you could be exposed.\n  The Obama administration CFPB significantly expanded regulatory \nrequirements associated with HMDA. Financial institutions now have to \nreport a total of 48 different data fields for each individual \nborrower. In fact, today's HMDA requirements are more than double the \nstatutory requirements established by Congress.\n  What do we get for all of this box checking? Not a lot, beyond a more \nburdensome process that, in the best case scenario, slows the borrowing \nprocess. These rules and regulations make it more and more difficult \nfor small institutions to absorb costs and results in constricted \ncredit and higher price for consumers' and customers' needs.\n  Compliance with HMDA requirements is one of the top concerns and \nfrustrations I hear from community banks in Missouri. And, in fact, we \nhad a hearing recently, where we had the president of an institution in \nthere, and he had a file that was this thick, Mr. Speaker, over 3-\ninches thick. And I asked him: How many pages do you have in that file? \nAnd he said: Congressman, we don't measure it by the page anymore. We \nmeasure it by the pound.\n  This legislation aims to address some of those concerns. H.R. 2954 \nwould exempt small community banks and credit unions from new HMDA \nreporting requirements. It is my understanding that this relief would \napply to other mortgage lending institutions as well, including lenders \nwho make loans on manufactured housing.\n  We have an opportunity today to put our vote where our mouth is and \nsupport legislation that will grant relief to the Nation's smallest \nfinancial institutions and enable more access to credit for our \ncustomers and members of our local communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, again, the gentleman from Minnesota for \nhis outstanding work on this legislation and his work on behalf of our \nfinancial institutions and their customers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of the Home Mortgage Disclosure \nAdjustment Act."], "Mr. CLAY": ["2018-03-05", "  Mr. CLAY.

My hope is that Congress will pass a bill \nthat provides certainty for DREAMers while also bringing meaningful \nimprovements to our visa programs for seasonal workers and our highly \nskilled immigrants, along with providing resources for enhanced border \nsecurity.\n  We know that not every special interest group will get everything \nthey want, but I believe, if we work together, we can give the American \npeople exactly what they expect: an improved immigration system that we \ndesperately need.\n"], "Mr. MORAN": ["2018-01-18", "  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, when we complete our work today on the FISA \nissue, we will be consumed by the issue of a continuing resolution and \nthe need for continued appropriations to keep government functions \navailable to the American people.\n  I come with a suggestion that I think is based not on politics but \nupon commonsense and perhaps just the good business aspect of getting \nour work done. My suggestion to our colleagues is that we do not shut \ndown government. I think the outcome of that is not good, and I can \nlist the reasons. I have had constituents from time to time tell me \n``shut her down. It wouldn't matter to me,'' but I can list the \ncircumstances in which it really does matter to everyday folks in \nKansas and across the country. At the same time, we should force \nourselves to do work that we seemingly are unwilling or unable to \ncomplete. There is a whole list of things that are pending, and they \nhave been pending for a long time.\n  The Presiding Officer and I serve on the Appropriations Committee, \nand one of the positions that I think we share is the desire to see \nthat the appropriations process works. That means that we would do a \nbudget. The Budget Committee would do a budget, and the Senate and the \nHouse would approve the budget. We would do 12 appropriations bills \nthat fill in the budget space. We would be able to prioritize spending. \nWe could increase, reduce, or eliminate spending. Then, we could again \nsend a message to agencies, departments, and cabinets that we have the \nability to determine how much money they have to spend and, therefore, \nhave the opportunity to influence decisions that are made that affect \nthe American people through the bureaucracy and through the \nadministration in such significant ways.\n  So the goal here is to keep government functioning--no shutdown--but \nalso to have the discipline necessary to put an appropriations process \nin place to get us out of a CR.\n  Immigration, from DACA to border security, is certainly a topic of \nconversation in Congress, and negotiations are apparently ongoing and \nit is an issue that needs to be resolved. If we are going to make fixes \nto our immigration system, now is better than later. If border security \nis important, now is better than later to improve border security. If \ncertainty in people's lives is important, now is better than later.\n  Many of us have a concern that we are not adequately funding the \ndefense side. We face many threats, from China in the Pacific to Russia \nand its intrusion, from cyber issues that affect our national security \nto terrorism and the Middle East. If additional money is necessary for \nour intelligence capabilities and for our national defense, now is \nbetter than later.\n  What may happen here is that we will pass a continuing resolution \nthat takes us weeks into the future and we will operate under a \ncontinuing resolution, or, if that is not possible, nothing may pass \nfor several days and the so-called government shutdown would occur.\n  Here is what I would ask us to do. Let us do a continuing resolution \nfor a day or so at a time, keeping government open, which puts the \npressure on negotiations to occur to resolve the variety of issues that \nare out there today that, in all likelihood, will be attached to a \nfinal resolution. The question is, Do we do it now? Do we force those \nnegotiations to occur and a resolution of those issues to happen? Do we \nforce that today by being in a continuing resolution that is a very \nshort period of time? Or do we give ourselves another month to allow \nthe conversations to continue, and, in all likelihood, if history is \nany indication, a month from now we will be saying: Well, we need \nanother CR while we continue.\n  The issues are important that are before us, and Congress has the \nhabit of delaying resolutions of issues until the moment of crisis \narrives. My point is this: Keep the pressure on us today. Do not let us \nwalk away from here now without keeping government open, but do not let \nus leave the Senate and the Congress until we have resolved the issues \nin front of us. Those issues include healthcare, immigration, funding \nfor national defense, domestic spending, and issues related to \ndisaster--the Senator who presides today is from Florida--whether or \nnot we do disaster assistance, which is a need as a result of the \nhurricanes that have caused tremendous damage in Texas and Florida and \nPuerto Rico. If we need that disaster relief--if it is needed--it is \nneeded now, not later.\n  I have raised this topic. I have had this conversation with many of \nmy colleagues.\n  I encourage us to continue to resolve our differences today--they \nwill not be easier tomorrow--and make certain that we have an \nopportunity for us to then deal with the important issues that are \nstill ahead of us. Outside of any agreement that might be reached in \nthe next several days, we need to deal with issues that are important--\nwhat I would describe as issues that we will be dealing with that are \nnormally important to us in May and June. But May and June will be \noccupied by the things we should have resolved now. So that in May and \nJune, we will do the things we could have done today, and we will not \nbe taking care of the July issues.\n  Common sense tells me that we can find a solution to the problems if \nwe work at it, but if we allow ourselves to escape from the process \ntoday or tomorrow--if we return home--we will be\n\n\nback in the same position next week and the week after that and the \nweek after, which we are in today.\n  It is just a simple plea that the Senate exhibit some common sense, \nsome good business practices. Let's resolve our differences now, and \nthen let's take on the next issues that are so important to the \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "Mr. BACON": ["2018-02-26", "  Mr. BACON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 75th anniversary \nof the Queen City Airport located in Allentown, Pennsylvania. \nThroughout its history, the airport has served the Lehigh Valley \ncommunity in a variety of ways. From its beginnings as a military base \nduring World War II to the small business transportation hub it is \ntoday, Queen City Airport has been vital to Pennsylvania's 15th \nCongressional District.\n  Originally Convair Airfield, the 325-acre airport was built by \nConsolidated-Vultee Aircraft Incorporated in September 1943. The space \nfunctioned as the test site for the Navy's Seawolf torpedo bombers, \nwhich were built at the nearby Mack Trucks' plant. Eighty-six bombers \nwere tested at the Convair facility, but the war concluded before any \nof the planes were commissioned for duty.\n  The City of Allentown purchased the government land on July 10, 1947, \nand in addition to the land, the government parted with Convair \nAirfield--valued at over $1 million--for $1 under the condition that \nAllentown maintained the land for aviation purposes.\n  After Allentown acquired Convair Airfield, the military called upon \nthe airfield for training exercises during the Cold War. In 1948, the \nPennsylvania National Guard leased the airport for Army reserve flight \ntraining. This prevented Lehigh Valley reservists from needing to \ntravel long distances to receive critical training. The National Guard \nonce again used Convair in 1949 for Operation Vultee One, which was a \nseries of simulated bombing attacks.\n  The lease was transferred to Air Products & Chemicals, an industrial \ngas business with deep Lehigh Valley roots, in 1951. The company \nutilized Convair for mounting oxygen generating equipment on military \ntrailers and producing valves and gauges. Air Products & Chemicals \nremained at Convair for 15 years before ending its lease with Allentown \nin 1966.\n  On May 15, 1961, Allentown took over the day-to-day operations of the \nairfield and officially renamed it Queen City Municipal Airport. This \nmarked the beginning of private use of the land, starting with Spirax-\nSarco, a maker of steam and heat transfer systems. The city sold the \nairport to the Lehigh-Northampton Airport Authority in 2000 after fifty \nyears of ownership.\n  Today, Queen City Airport is home to 90 planes that are used by small \nbusiness owners in the Lehigh Valley. The airport allows these business \nowners to avoid long waits behind commercial flights at Lehigh Valley \nInternational Airport (LVIA) and freely conduct their business travel. \nAdditional hangars to accommodate more planes are in the airport \nauthority's long-term plan since Queen City has experienced increased \nutilization in recent years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would ask the House to join me in acknowledging Queen \nCity Airport's history of serving our government as well as the 15th \nCongressional District of Pennsylvania.

George Washington would welcome an opulent \nand respected stranger, you know, like folks from Norway. However, we \nshould also welcome the oppressed and the persecuted of all nations and \nall religions in the world.\n  Compare George Washington's words to President Trump's, who said: ``I \ndo business with the Mexican people, but you have people coming through \nthe border that are from all over. And they are bad. They are really \nbad. You have people coming in, and I am not just saying Mexicans. I am \ntalking about people who are from all over that are killers and \nrapists, and they are coming into this country.''\n  Please, Mr. Speaker, do not let this era be known as the day that \nAmerica surrendered. Do not let our country go down the path of \nreligious persecution. Do not let our country fall to the dictates of \nconvenience.\n  The United States of America sets the tone for the rest of the world. \nIn other words, Mr. Speaker, if we do not help the less fortunate than \nus, who can we count on?\n  It is not easy to say no, Mr. Speaker.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy \nof a great American, a messenger for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, \nand arguably the finest man North Carolina has ever produced: the \nReverend Billy Graham.\n  William Franklin Graham, Jr., was born in 1919 in Charlotte, North \nCarolina, where he grew up the son of a farmer. In 1939, he was \nordained as a minister; thus, beginning what would be his life's \ncalling.\n  It was in 1949 that Reverend Graham gained the international \nprominence he is known for today. It was that year that he hosted his \nLos Angeles Crusade. Originally scheduled to last only 3 weeks, it \nended up continuing for over 2 months. Throughout that time, huge \ncrowds came to hear Reverend Graham spread the gospel of Christ.\n  In the years following the Los Angeles Crusade, Reverend Graham's \nstature only grew. He traveled across the United States and around the \nworld to spread the good word and encourage his fellow men and women to \nfind salvation with Christ and in Christ. He would fill everything from \nsmall churches to massive football stadiums.\n  According to the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Reverend \nGraham preached to over 215 million people in over 185 countries and \nterritories around the world during his life. But his influence did not \nstop there.\n  Throughout his ministry, Reverend Graham became known as America's \nPastor, serving as a moral compass for our Nation. He served as a \nspiritual adviser to countless American and international political \nleaders and civic leaders, including every American President since \nHarry Truman.\n  In the 1950s and 1960s, he joined with Martin Luther King, Jr., for \nintegrated crusades, a powerful statement from a White southerner at \nthat time. He delivered invocations at the inaugurations of four \nAmerican Presidents. In 1983, he was awarded our Nation's highest \ncivilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President Ronald \nReagan.\n  Following the horrific attacks on our Nation on September 11, 2001, \nit was Reverend Graham who comforted our Nation from the pulpit of \nWashington's National Cathedral.\n\n  While best known for his work as America's Pastor, there is much more \nto Reverend Graham. Foremost among those was his marriage to his \nbeloved wife, Ruth. Reverend Graham and Ruth met at Illinois' Wheaton \nCollege, but it was Ruth's hometown of Montreat, a small town in \nwestern North Carolina's Swannanoa Valley, which I am honored to \nrepresent in North Carolina, that they chose to call home. It is a \nsmall town, a humble town.\n  It was at the Gaither Chapel on the campus of Montreat College where \nReverend Graham and Ruth were married in 1943. From there, the Grahams \nbuilt a home on Montreat's Little Piney Ridge. It was at that home that \nthe Graham's raised their five children: Virginia, Anne, Ruth, \nFranklin, and Nelson. Certainly, Reverend Graham's public works were \nextraordinary, but what he and Ruth built as a family is enduring, \nindeed.\n  While an international icon for his work spreading the gospel of \nChrist, Reverend Graham and his family were simply great neighbors to \nthe American people of Montreat and the nearby town of Black Mountain. \nAccording to a story in the Black Mountain News, Reverend Graham was \nknown to occasionally attend services at Swannanoa's First Baptist \nChurch, play golf at the Black Mountain Golf Course, and grab lunch at \nthe Coach House restaurant in town.\n  One of the finest moments of my career was having the opportunity to \nserve as Reverend Graham's Representative in Washington when his home \nin Montreat was placed in the 10th District. It was then that I had the \nhonor of traveling up Little Piney Ridge to visit Reverend Graham in \nhis home. The personal kindness and hospitality he showed in inviting \nme into his home is something that I will never forget.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to each of Reverend Graham's five \nchildren, to all their grandchildren and great-grandchildren who have \nlost a mentor and a friend. As a nation, we are forever indebted to \nReverend Graham for his years of service to our State, our Nation, and \nto this world. It is only befitting that tomorrow Reverend Graham will \nreturn here to Washington one final time to lie in honor in the rotunda \nof this great building.\n  Mr. Speaker, I conclude by noting that Reverend Graham has passed on \nfrom this world, but he has moved into the kingdom he preached about \nfor so many years. He has rejoined his beloved wife, Ruth, and has \nfinally been called home to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ following \na life well lived.\n"], "Mr. CHABOT": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. CHABOT.

He will be awarded the Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal, \nwhich is given to an individual whose cumulative record of service \nreflects a pattern of increasing levels of responsibility, strategic \nimpact, and distinctly exceptional achievements.\n  J.

At \nthe age of ten, his family moved to Macon, Georgia, where he was \nenrolled in the Bibb County School System. After graduating from \nCentral High School, he went on to earn\n\n\na bachelor's degree in Political Science from the University of Georgia \nin 1985. Shortly after receiving his degree, he began his illustrious \ncareer with the CIA.\n  For over three decades, Mr. Stembridge was a well-respected leader at \nthe CIA. He built quite an impressive career, which was amplified in \n2005 when he entered into the Senior Intelligence Service. During his \ntenure in the Senior Intelligence Service, he held several leadership \nroles including Deputy Director of the Office of Congressional Affairs \nand completed several overseas tours in areas of conflict. In December \n2016, after serving for over 31 years, Mr. Stembridge retired from the \nCIA.\n  He currently serves as the Executive Vice President of Intelligence \nover the National Security Solutions unit of Pacific Architects and \nEngineers (PAE) and works directly with domestic and foreign government \nagencies within the intelligence community.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, ``Life's most persistent and \nurgent question is, `What are you doing for others?'

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the \nlife and work of Debra King, the chief executive of Community \nAlternatives for Supportive Abodes--known simply as ``CASA''--a \nnonprofit that has developed housing for thousands in the Triangle \ncounties in North Carolina. Debra died on April 14. My staff joins me \nin this Tribute, for we have long admired and supported her work to \nensure decent housing for some of the most vulnerable people in our \ncommunity.\n  Born and raised on a small farm in Beulaville, North Carolina in \n1959, Debra was the first in her family to earn a college degree, \nmajoring in journalism at The University of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill. Following graduation, she settled in Raleigh, where she began \nwork as a medical transcriptionist. She soon transitioned into what \nwould become a lifelong passion for non-profit work, beginning as a \ngrant writer for Orange-Person-Chatham Mental Health. One of the first \ngrants she landed was for a housing project to support individuals with \nmental illnesses, a project that set her on course as a champion for \naffordable housing.\n  Soon after, the Wake County Area Mental Health Program launched CASA, \nseeking to secure housing for people with disabilities and mental \nhealth challenges. In 1995, CASA asked Debra to serve as its Director \nand CEO, overseeing 15 apartments with one other staff member.\n  CASA's housing model was unique and far-sighted for its time. Rather \nthan housing people with illnesses in group homes or transitional \nhousing, the organization provided permanent, safe, and affordable \nunits with access to public transportation and supportive services as \nneeded. Through 22 years of remarkable social entrepreneurship, Debra \nhelped the non-profit grow to a staff of 27, managing nearly 500 units \nin Wake, Durham, and Orange counties.\n  Debra's years at CASA coincided with most of my years working on \naffordable housing on the House Appropriations Committee. She was \nmasterful at pursuing available funding -picking up on the national \nmandate, for example, to end veterans' homelessness-and putting \ntogether the partnerships to put units on the ground. In the process \nshe taught me and the other elected officials and staff with whom she \nworked how to make public programs most effective. It was a joy to cut \nribbons on completed projects with her, but the spirit of those \noccasions was always, ``We've got to do more.''\n  When she was named ``Tar Heel of the Week'' by the Raleigh News & \nObserver in 2015, Debra declared: ``The greatest gift we can give \npeople is the chance to be who they are . . . Housing is so critical to \nwho we are. If you lack that, how can you be okay?'' She was a stalwart \nbeliever and advocate for the ``Housing First'' philosophy, insisting \nthat individuals in crisis will see better outcomes if their basic \nneeds, particularly decent housing, are met from the onset.\n  Debra's compassion and dedication to her cause, combined with hard \nwork and business acumen, have bettered the lives of many in the \ngreater Raleigh area and have left behind a strong organization--\nincluding many who have learned and drawn inspiration from her--that \nwill continue to serve. We join with Debra's family, her many friends \nand admirers, and members of the communities she served, in mourning \nher passing and honoring her life of compassionate leadership and \npublic service.\n"], "Mr. PASCRELL": ["2018-01-18", "  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 2018 XXIII \nOlympic Winter Games being hosted in Pyeongchang, South Korea, next \nmonth. I am proud of the many Korean Americans in the Ninth \nCongressional District who make the USA a better place to live.\n  The Olympic Games serve as a forum for the international community to \ncome together to build a peaceful world. In order to be a competitor in \nthe Olympic Games, nations across the globe have to embody the values \nand ideals of friendship, solidarity, and fair play. It is no different \nin the diplomatic arena.\n  Without these core values, the spirit of fair competition is eroded. \nThe common bond that brings nations from all over the world to compete \nand build friendships serves as a forum to promote tolerance and \nunderstanding. Promoting these ideals is critical to these increasingly \ntroubled times, and I believe the results can make our world a more \npeaceful place.\n  The upcoming Winter Olympic Games presents a significant opportunity \nfor the United States of America to lead the fight against \ninternational conflicts and to promote peace. This is our legacy.\n  Our Nation can use this opportunity to work with the international \ncommunity in a way that shows that we can come together in the spirit \nof healthy competition, regardless of our differences.\n  With the long shadow being cast by the provocations of Pyongyang and \nrhetoric from our own administration, the Olympic Winter Games came at \nthe right time. They are an opportunity for the United States to speak \nout in support of resolving the current conflicts on the Korean \nPeninsula.\n  While there are many issues facing the international community, all \ncan agree the growing threat of nuclear conflict presents the most \nimmediate danger. In order to deescalate the growing threat, and in the \nspirit of the Olympic Games themselves, I hope that our athletes' \npresence in South Korea will serve as a symbolic representation that \nour differences can be worked out on a neutral field.\n  Further, it is reassuring that North Korea will participate in the \nupcoming Winter Olympics. If the reports are true, it will be \nencouraging to watch the two countries' athletes march together at the \nopening ceremony under a unification flag. That surpasses the \nconsequences of empty rhetorical threats. We can do better than that.\n\n  It took the Winter Olympics to thaw the ice between the two nations, \nwho have not met in 2 years. This is a welcome sign of easing tensions \nafter months of alarm over North Korea's nuclear program.\n  As a result, this year's Olympic Games are already off to a great \nstart. The Games will continue to be a reminder that, regardless of \nwhere someone is from, we can still set our differences aside for a \nbetter world, just like the first athletes who came together to start \nthe Olympic tradition.\n  It is my expectation that the Republic of Korea will host a \nsuccessful 2018 XXIII Olympic Winter Games and that the hard work and \ndedication of the Korean people to this endeavor will be remembered by \nthe international community.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I look forward to watching the men and women \nrepresenting the United States of America bring home the gold.\n"], "The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Ferguson)": ["2018-02-26", "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Ferguson).

A ``yes'' vote today will say we stand \nwith those men and women who buy food every single day; for those \npaycheck-to-paycheck families whose rent doesn't change, their car \npayment doesn't change. If something happens to them, it comes out of \ntheir food budget. Why on Earth would we intentionally try to screw \nthose folks over by raising the cost of food, by not continuing this \nprocess and moving forward?\n  Mr. Speaker, this is pretty darn simple. Very darn simple. Either \nvote with those SNAP recipients whose lives would be better, whose \nimpact will be better, or you vote against them.\n  You will vote with the men and women who suffered through the \nterrible times in the last 5 years, the worst since the Depression, or \nyou vote ``no.''\n\n\n  There is no group of Americans more in tune to what goes on on this \nfloor than the men and women of production agriculture. It is vital to \ntheir livelihood, vital to their existence, what we do here tonight.\n  And you will hear a lot of rhetoric about those red votes, reasons \nwhy they voted ``no'' on it, but I guarantee you, those farmers and \nranchers back home that are watching this clock and watching what \nhappens, they will understand what it means. They will understand that \nthose ``yes'' votes mean we are going to move this process forward. We \nare going to continue to attempt to give them the assurance over the \nnext 5 years what this farm bill will do for them and how they will \nstay in business, how their bankers will make plans in moving this \nthing forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have had 3 years of hard work on this, 114 hearings. \nWe are ready to move this bill forward.

The violence left \nhundreds of Armenian civilians dead and injured, women and girls were \nraped, and some victims were burned alive.

But \nagain, if this one does not pass now, the Federal Government will shut \ndown.\n  This is no time to shortchange our first responders, our military as \nwe continue to recover from natural disasters in places all throughout \nour country and, again, respond to the threats that face us abroad. \nThis is no time to shut down the Federal Government.\n  The CR supports ongoing transportation safety missions, including air \ntraffic control.\n  Again, we cannot allow the government to shut down and put all of \nthat in jeopardy.\n  It allows us to continue to house the most vulnerable families, \nespecially our veterans. This is not the time to let them down by \nshutting, again, the Federal Government down.\n  It also funds medical care for millions of children, blocks \nburdensome health insurance taxes, and, again, supports mission-\ncritical defense activities. This is not the time to let them all down \nand shut down the Federal Government.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, this short-term CR will allow us to work \ntogether to find common ground on, again, full-year 2018 bills that \nmeet both our defense and domestic priorities.\n  Something else, Mr. Speaker. I want the country to know that we also \nhave to deal, have to solve the issue of DACA. Both sides have been at \nfault for, in many cases, refusing to sit down in good faith to \nnegotiate a solution. This CR gives us some time to make sure we solve \nthat issue.\n  It is not time now for political games and gamesmanship and politics. \nWe need to be able to solve the issue of those young folks. We can't do \nthat if the government is shut down.\n\n  It is time for leadership, for courage. Let's sit down, work out our \ndifferences, help secure the border, and provide a solution for these \ndeserving kids.\n  For that reason and for so many others, Mr. Speaker, it is essential \nthat we do not allow the Federal Government to shut down.

Mr. President, today, along with my colleague Senator Mike \nCrapo, I wish to recognize fellow Idahoan Larry Cope who retired from \nClear Springs Foods, Inc., in Buhl, ID, in March of this year. Larry, \nwho is president and CEO of the company, has had an exemplary career as \na visionary and selfless leader at Clear Springs for the past 45 years. \nHe deserves to retire.\n  Idaho is very proud to be home to the headquarters of Clear Springs \nFoods, the world's largest producer of aquacultured rainbow trout, \nsupplying restaurants and major supermarkets throughout the United \nStates and propelling fish farming well beyond our borders. Larry would \ntell us it has taken a great team to lead this originally privately \nowned small business into the immensely successful 100-percent \nemployee-owned operation it is\n\n\ntoday, but we know it was with Larry's cutting-edge leadership and \ndistinguished commitment to the business that it has grown into such a \nglobal industry.\n  In 1973, with just $10,000--money critical to the company at the \ntime--and a true spirit of recognizing the value of good workers, Larry \ncreated an employee retirement plan and stayed committed to the plan. \nToday the retirement fund is more than $60 million. Larry believes in \ntaking care of his workers, many of whom go in every day to do \ndifficult, routine work. Larry exhibits the type of leader every \nindustry needs: focused while looking ahead, kind, fair, and employee \nfriendly. No one has to tell him to serve in this manner; it is who he \nis, and he does it with a spring in his step.\n  Mike and I have known Larry since the days Clear Springs had an \nannual production of 450,000 pounds of trout. Now, the company produces \n24 million pounds every year, making it an exemplary industry leader.\n  Larry has been immensely valuable to the aquaculture industry \nworldwide. He has been in many leadership roles in business \nassociations and boards, and he has won many awards. To name a few of \nhis roles in the food industry and beyond, Larry has served as a board \nmember and chairman of the National Fisheries Institute, the American \nFrozen Food Institute, the Idaho Association of Commerce & Industry, as \nwell as St. Luke's Health System. In addition, he has served as a \ntrustee at the College of Idaho, his alma mater.\n  Another important character quality Larry exhibits is believing in \nserving his community. He is a pillar of support and encouragement to \nthe region, having helped bring St. Luke's Hospital into the Magic \nValley, as well as supporting the growth of the region's food \nproduction industry. As food production grows, so does the number of \njobs and residual businesses. This is good growth for Idaho.\n  Mike and I are proud to recognize Larry Cope, our good friend and a \nstrong, courageous, and dedicated leader in Idaho. As I said a minute \nago, Larry has done so much in business and community service for more \nthan 45 years that he has earned his retirement.\n  Larry, kick up your feet and go fishing.\n  Thank you.\n"], "Mr. KEATING": ["2018-02-26", "  Mr. KEATING.

To manage the country \nwith a zero deficit is not smart economic policy.\n  Third, it is being presented to the American people in a deceitful \nmanner. To compare fiscal planning of the U.S. Government to how \nhardworking families in this country should manage their own personal \nfinances is misrepresenting how we should think about our government.\n  And fourth, it is being done entirely for political reasons: to \ndirect attention away from tax legislation that has materially \nincreased the deficit of this country.\n  If we wanted to have an honest conversation about the fiscal \nsituation of this country, which is terrible and projected to be worse, \nwe would focus on three numbers: The first number we would focus on, or \nthe first percentage, is our debt as a percentage of our economy; the \nsecond ratio we would focus on is how much we think our economy could \ngrow each year; and the third number we would focus on is the \npercentage of our deficit as expressed relative to our economy.\n  If we actually wanted to work together, if the majority and the \nminority wanted to work together and put together a fiscal plan for \nthis country that was responsible, that represented smart economics, \nallowed us to invest in our country, and put us on a trajectory where \nthe debt, as a percentage of our economy, would go down over time and \nreturn to normal levels, then we\n\n\nwould be talking about how do we come up with a budget that had \ndeficits on an annual basis of minus 1.5 to 2 percent.\n  That wouldn't put us in a position where we have to slash so many \nimportant government programs because this government has insufficient \ntax revenues.

Mr. President, the Senate Baltic Freedom Caucus has \nbeen without a Republican cochair.\n  This is a critical time to show solidarity with our Baltic allies, \ngiven Russian aggression against Ukraine starting in 2014, following on \nRussian military intervention in the Republic of Georgia in 2008.\n  It is also a significant milestone year for all three Baltic \ncountries as they celebrate the 100th anniversary of their statehood. \nAs such, it is important that the Baltic Freedom Caucus have its \nleadership in place. I have been a member of the Baltic Freedom Caucus \nfor some time, and I have now agreed to be the Republican cochair, \nalong with Senator Durbin, who is the longtime Democrat cochair.\n  So, in my new capacity as cochair of the Senate Baltic Freedom \nCaucus, I would like to offer congratulations first to the Republic of \nLithuania, which celebrated 100 years since the establishment of the \nmodern Lithuanian state on February 16.\n  I say the modern state because Lithuanians trace their country's \nhistory to 1253. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania controlled a large amount \nof territory from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea during medieval \ntimes. It later joined with Poland as the Polish-Lithuanian \nCommonwealth. Then, with the partitions of Poland starting in the 18th \ncentury, it came under the control of the Russian empire.\n  In the wake of World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution, on February \n16, 1918, representatives of the Lithuanian nation signed the Act of \nIndependence of Lithuania ``reestablishing an independent state, based \non democratic principles.'' Lithuania today holds true to those \nprinciples. This makes it a natural and close ally of the United States \nand other freedom-loving nations. In fact, the Lithuanian Government \nhas become a particularly outspoken defender of democratic principles \nin the face of attacks on those principles by its large neighbor, \nRussia.\n  I would also like to recognize the Republic of Estonia, which marked \n100 years of statehood on February 24. Like the United States, Estonia \ncounts its statehood starting with its declaration of independence. \nAlso like the United States, Estonia had to fight a war against an \nempire with a much larger army to secure its independence. Actually, \nEstonia had to fight both the German empire and Bolshevik Russia.\n  Germany gave up when it lost World War I, and Soviet Russia was \npushed back by the new Estonian army, ultimately signing the Treaty of \nTartu that recognized the independence of Estonia in perpetuity. More \nrecently, the Estonian army has fought side by side with the United \nStates in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Estonia is one of the few NATO \nallies that meets its commitment to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense.\n  I should add that Latvians will celebrate their 100th anniversary of \nstatehood in November, so there will be time to congratulate them in \ndue course, but I should mention that there are many connections \nbetween Latvia and Iowa.\n  Iowa was partnered with Latvia in a civic education exchange program \na number of years ago; a prominent Iowan, Chuck Larson, served as \nAmbassador to Latvia from 2008 to 2009; and we have a Latvian-American \ncommunity in Iowa.\n  Some people may have a vague notion that the Baltics are breakaway \nSoviet republics, but that is not accurate if you know your history. On \nthe eve of World War II, the Soviets and the Nazis signed the Molotov-\nRibbentrop Pact, which contained a secret protocol agreeing to divide \nup several sovereign countries between them. The Nazis were to get \nwestern Poland, and the Soviets claimed the Baltic countries and \nFinland, eastern Poland, and the part of Romania that is now the \nRepublic of Moldova. Then both totalitarian governments proceeded to \ntake those territories by force, although the Finns only lost part of \nthe Karelia region after repelling the Soviet invasion in the Winter \nWar.\n  The Soviets organized rigged elections and claimed that the Baltic \ncountries voluntarily joined the Soviet Union. However, the United \nStates never recognized the annexation of these countries, and we \ncontinued to maintain diplomatic relations with the three Baltic \ncountries throughout the Cold War.\n  The Lithuanian Embassy is still in its original location, and during \nthe Soviet occupation, the Estonian representative to the United States \nbecame the longest serving member of the Washington diplomatic corps.\n  In 1989, on the 50th anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, \ncitizens of the three Baltic countries formed a human chain connecting \nthe capital cities protesting the continued occupation and highlighting \nthe history of\n\n\nhow it came about, which was officially denied by the Soviet regime.\n  Vladimir Putin's regime continues to deny that the Baltic countries \nwere illegally occupied and to insist that they ceased to be \nindependent states when they were annexed in 1940.\n  In 2015, a member of the ruling party in Russia even initiated an \ninquiry with the Russian Prosecutor General as to the legality of the \ndecision allowing the independence of the Baltic states from the Soviet \nUnion in 1991. That decision was declared illegal. Since the entire 50-\nyear occupation of the Baltic countries was illegal, the legality of a \ndecision by a defunct evil empire is hardly relevant. What is relevant \nis that the current regime in Russia is continuing the Soviet legacy of \nrewriting history to fit its agenda. That is a form of political \nwarfare.\n  Many Americans are now waking up to the fact that the Putin regime is \nbent on undermining Western democracies.\n  Well, the Baltic countries have been warning about that for years \nwhile leaders of our government were cozying up to Putin and playing \naround with reset buttons.\n  Estonia was the subject of a massive propaganda campaign combined \nwith a cyber attack back in 2007 when it moved a Soviet war memorial to \na less conspicuous location.\n  Estonia's experience of weathering a cyber attack and its strong IT \nsector have made it a cybersecurity expert, and it now hosts the NATO \nCooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.\n  What Russia is doing now is out of the same KGB playbook it used \nthroughout the Cold War.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to say \n``pause,'' take a step back, reject the rule, and give ourselves a \nchance to, frankly, do it better.\n  FISA reauthorization is inarguably one of the most consequential \nvotes we will take in this Congress because the constitutional stakes \nare so high. Civil liberties are the core of our Bill of Rights, and we \nare asked to take action that affects them in the name of keeping us \nsafe. I get that.\n  But it is critical that we get it right. I think we can do better. To \nmake decisions of this magnitude, we should have the most robust \nprocess possible, full and open debate, and input from the \nstakeholders, thoughtful deliberations by the Members. The process for \nthis bill thus far has decidedly not been that, has not been great. It \nwas written and rewritten in secret and with minimal debate or \nstakeholders' input.\n  But--this is a big but--I am actually optimistic because I have seen \na change in the last few days and I think we have an opportunity here. \nThe administration is suddenly engaged, and we are seeing vibrant \ndebate from stakeholders in the technology sector, civil liberties \nadvocates. Members have had very serious discussions, including here on \nthe floor today, but in the Halls, offering amendments to rules, \nunfortunately, which are not being allowed--save one.\n  We are being asked to shut all that down, that opportunity, and push \nthrough an extension that will run for 6 years. Frankly, stop and \nthink: 6 years in the world of technology is an eternity.\n\n\n  So, for all these reasons, I ask my fellow Members to join me in \nopposing this rule and, instead, allow the House an opportunity to work \nits will, to take a little more time, and to do it better because we \nreally do need to wrestle with privacy, with what privacy means in a \nworld where our entire personal lives are stored somewhere online as \nones and zeros.

We are all being rendered \ninto nothing but a massive storehouse of ones and zeros.\n  The tensions or balance between civil liberties and national security \nis a debate as old as this country, but they are not mutually \nexclusive. They are hard--they are darn hard--but they are not mutually \nexclusive and they are not impossible.\n  I know well how many threats we face around the world and I don't \ntake them lightly. The fact that we have not faced another major \nterrorist attack since 9/11 is a testament to the skill and the hard \nwork of the intelligence community, and I tip my hat to them.

Our medical, financial, \nand legal records are all online; so are our photos. Our cell phones \ntrack us everywhere we go.\n  The data available on us is unprecedented, and the fundamental \nprinciple of the Bill of Rights is that we have the right to keep our \ndata private.

As \nWest Virginians, we take great pride in our history, and it is so \nimportant to instill this commitment to our values in the next \ngeneration. That is Dennis's legacy.\n  As a preservationist, Dennis is a cofounder and first president of \nthe Save Historic Antietam Foundation and is also a cofounder and \nformer president of the Civil War Trust. His lifetime achievements in \nthe Civil War history community have earned him numerous awards and \nrecognitions, including the Shelby Foote Award by the Civil War Trust \nand the Nevins-Freeman Award by the Civil War Roundtable of Chicago--\nthe first and oldest Civil War roundtable.\n  Dennis has authored nearly 100 articles and 10 books and also helped \nproduce the Emmy Award-winning television features about the Battle of \nAntietam, abolitionist John Brown, and Maryland during the Civil War. \nHe has been published in countless prestigious Civil War magazines, \nincluding Civil War Times Illustrated, America's Civil War, Blue & Gray \nMagazine, North and South Magazine, and Hallowed Ground and has been \nfeatured as a guest contributor to the Washington Post. His book, \n``Harpers Ferry Under Fire,'' received the national book of the year \naward from the Association of Partners for Public Lands. ``September \nSuspense: Lincoln's Union in Peril'' was awarded the 2012 Laney Book \nPrize for distinguished scholarship and writing on the military and \npolitical history of the Civil War.\n  Dennis is a highly sought after tour guide, having worked with the \nSmithsonian, National Geographic, and numerous colleges and \nuniversities. He has a remarkable gift for storytelling and has \ncertainly made history a favorite subject for countless students.\n  West Virginia is great because our people are great--Mountaineers who \nwill always be free. In fact, when visitors come to West Virginia, I \njump at the chance to tell them about our wonderful State. We have more \nveterans per capita than most any State in the Nation. We have fought \nin more wars, shed more blood, and lost more lives for the cause of \nfreedom than most any State. We have always done the heavy lifting and \nnever complained.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Shimkus, as \nwell, for continuing to bring light to the broken promise the Federal \nGovernment made to our communities.\n  The State of Minnesota is home to three nuclear reactors, two of \nwhich are at the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant in my \ndistrict. Located directly adjacent to the Prairie Island Indian \nReservation and the city of Red Wing, the plant has stored spent \nnuclear fuel on site since the 1970s. While this is done in a very safe \nand highly secure manner, storage in close proximity to large \ncommunities is simply not appropriate.\n  In 1982, Congress agreed and made it clear that they wanted the \nFederal Government to oversee and manage the storage of spent fuel. \nCongress did not want to put the burden and oversight of maintaining \nsafe nuclear storage on our local communities. The Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct was adopted, and the Federal Government was tasked with creating a \nnational Federal repository for used fuel.\n  The Federal Government began collecting taxes on all users of nuclear \npower. In the end, my constituents, businesses, and Americans \nthroughout the country have paid roughly $40 billion in taxes and \ninterest.\n  In 1995, due to the inaction at the Federal level the plant in my \ndistrict was forced to take matters into their own hands. While they \ncontinued to help fund a repository, they also invested in and began \noperating a dry cask storage area, a pad on site that could hold up to \n48 casks of fuel.\n\n  Now, that should have been more than enough to cover their needs \nuntil the Federal Government finished their job. Today, Prairie Island \nis home to 40 casks, with 7 more expected to be filled by 2020.\n  Thirty-six years after the passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, \nwe still have no repository. Prairie Island now has to go through the \nprocess of planning to expand their dry cask facilities in order to \naccommodate fuel they paid the Federal Government to dispose of.\n  So I strongly support the efforts of Chairman Shimkus, and that is \nwhy I cosponsored the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017. We \nowe it to our communities to follow through on our promise to provide a \nsafe place for storage.\n  Meanwhile, it isn't just our local communities that are impacted by \nthis inaction. When Congress passed a budget last year, I worked to \npoint out that the Federal Government had assumed major liabilities \nassociated with its failure to provide safe and environmentally \nfriendly storage. The GAO recently reported that the Federal \nGovernment's environmental liability alone is nearly $450 billion and \ngrowing.\n  At the same time, the funds collected from taxpayers to open a \nrepository have begun being diverted to other payout settlements and \njudgments based on our broken promise. By the end of fiscal year 2016, \n$6.1 billion had been paid out, with the Department of Energy \nestimating another $25 billion to follow.\n  It is time to keep our promise. Our communities expect it, and the \nFederal Government cannot afford not to do so.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong opposition \nto the Trump administration's proposal to lift a decades-old ban on \noffshore oil and gas drilling on our country's Atlantic and Pacific \nCoasts.\n  This proposal has to be one of the most irresponsible actions of the \nTrump administration. Currently, 94 percent of the Outer Continental \nShelf is off limits to drilling, and rightly so, given the importance \nof protecting the economic and cultural value of the country's \ncoastlines.\n  The Trump administration has offered a staggering reversal, proposing \nto open up over 90 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf to oil and \ngas drilling. While Governors and lawmakers from both parties have \nrisen to voice their opposition to this plan, this administration is \nmoving forward at a breakneck speed. It has given a mere 60 days for \nthe public to comment. In my home State of Maine, which has much to \nlose from this plan, we don't even get a full public hearing.\n  This proposal's lack of transparency and fairness couldn't have been \nmore apparent than when Governor Rick Scott of Florida somehow earned \nan exemption for his State. Everyone can see that this was less about \nprotecting Florida's pristine beaches and coastline, as Governor Scott \nsaid, than a political favor from President Trump.\n  Mr. Speaker, I absolutely have nothing against the Florida coast. But \nthe State shouldn't have to be home to Mar-a-Lago to earn an exemption \nfrom this awful plan. All coastal States deserve this protection.\n  My home State of Maine is one of them. If you measured every inch of \nour State's jagged coastline and islands, it would measure an \nincredible 3,500 miles. Those miles include some of the most beautiful \nplaces in the world and critical habitat for hundreds of species of \nfish and wildlife.\n  That coast is also dotted with dozens of small towns filled with \nhardworking people who depend on a beautiful, healthy ocean to make \ntheir living.\n  Two of my State's largest industries are tourism and fishing. Tourism \nin Maine is a $5.6 billion industry, 71 percent of which comes directly \nin from the Maine coast. Millions of people visit our State to \nexperience our beautiful coastline, snug harbors, and stunning \nlandmarks, like the Marshall Point Lighthouse in Port Clyde.\n  Our fishing industry and businesses that support it have even more to \nlose from this proposal. Thirty thousand Mainers make their living in \nmarine industries. They include boat builders, ground fishermen, \nclammers, seaweed harvesters, oyster and mussel farmers, and, of \ncourse, lobstermen.\n  Our world-famous lobster fishing industry alone brings in $500 \nmillion annually. I have had so many discussions with the lobster \nfishermen who tell me about all the difficulties their industry already \nfaces. They want to pass their businesses on to their sons and \ndaughters, but they worry about the future.\n  Will the Gulf of Maine, which is already warming faster than 99.9 \npercent\n\n\nof the world's ocean waters, remain prime habitat for lobster? Will \nocean acidification harm the lobster population and shellfish in ways \nwe don't already know about yet?\n  Do we really need to add the potential of an oil spill to the list of \nthings that already keep them up at night?\n  In Maine, we know the risk because we have seen the consequences. In \n1996, a tanker named the Julie N. spilled about 200,000 gallons of \nheating oil in Maine's Casco Bay. It cost over $40 million to clean up \nand it caused lobster prices to plummet.\n\n  About 200,000 gallons of spilled oil is a drop in the bucket when you \ntalk about the spilled oil from the Deepwater Horizon, which spilled \n200 million gallons into the Gulf of Mexico. The result on the marine \nenvironment was devastating. Shrimp, crab, oyster, and other fisheries \nin those States may never fully recover.\n  The risks of this proposal to my State and others are simply too \ngreat. And for what? Our Nation is already the top producer of oil and \ngas in the world, and with fuel prices currently low, this proposal \nwould not boost the economy.\n  If this administration is really worried about remaining \ninternationally competitive in the energy market, it should throw its \nsupport behind developing alternative energy sources instead of \nabandoning them.\n  This proposal is unacceptable and irresponsible. I will continue to \nfight back against the environmental and economic harm it threatens for \nMaine and the Nation. I am proud to cosponsor legislation with my \ncolleagues in New England to prohibit drilling off our States, and \nanother bill to keep the drilling ban in place entirely along the \nAtlantic and Pacific Coasts. I encourage all my colleagues to do the \nsame and to stop this terrible plan before it is too late.\n"], "Mr. GALLEGO": ["2018-03-08", "  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that, for 242 years, \nwhenever and wherever America's freedom has been threatened, we called \nin the Marines.\n  A Marine Corps infantry platoon is trained to close with and destroy \nthe enemy by firearm and maneuver. That is what we do. That is our \npurpose. Marines kick in the door and kill the bad guys. Period. I know \nbecause that is what I had to do in Iraq. My platoon fought door-to-\ndoor against deadly insurgents. For this mission, the Marine Corps \nissued me an M-16 A4.\n  The M-16 is a weapon designed with exquisite precision for the \nsingular purpose of killing as many people as possible in the shortest \namount of time. It is not for deer hunting. It is for killing people.\n  The original M-16 was relentlessly refined to take enemy lives in \ncombat. But you might know the version available in stores called an \nAR-15. Republicans and their bosses at the NRA believe almost anyone \nshould be able to carry this weapon of war. That is right. Republicans \nhonestly believe that this killing machine has a place in our \ncommunities. They think that a weapon very similar to one I carried in \nAl Anbar belongs on the streets of Phoenix.\n\n  That is idiotic, and I will explain why.\n  Republicans aren't just ignoring the voices of the thousands of \nvictims. They are also denying basic physics. Because a round from an \nAR-15 is larger and leaves the muzzle traveling faster, it will impact \nthe body without about three times more energy than a bullet from a \nhandgun.\n  Surgeons treating the Parkland victims described organs that looked \nlike ``overripe melons smashed by a sledgehammer.'' They talk about \nexit wounds as big as oranges. They recount opening bodies of these \nchildren, hoping to stem the bleeding, and discovering that, as one \ndoctor put it, ``there was nothing left to repair.''\n  And here is the thing: that is not an unexpected outcome. Delivering \nfatal wounds that no surgeon can fix is the whole point of these \nweapons. That is precisely why they were given to us in combat.\n  The AR-15 also has a standard magazine of 30 rounds. Those 30 rounds \nare necessary if you are putting down suppressive fire or engaging \ninsurgents. They are not very useful when you are hunting deer.\n  Mr. Speaker, I can confidently say that if you need more than a \nhandful of shots to put down the deer, you are probably the problem, \nnot the weapon.\n  In addition, the AR-15 has a significantly faster effective rate of \nfire than a bolt-action hunting rifle or a handgun. That means you can \nshoot more people in less time. That means police officers responding \nto the scene of a shooting will be outgunned and outmatched. That means \nmore children will die in the classrooms before help can arrive.\n  I went through literally thousands of hours of training to become a \nmarine. It was arduous and grueling. I was taught how to clean and care \nfor my weapon. I had to pass a rigorous marksmanship test. I was only \narmed after I earned the privilege and responsibility for that weapon.\n  In contrast, my Republican friends think anyone should be able to \nwalk into a sporting goods store anywhere in America and walk out with \nan AR-15.\n  When children are slaughtered in their classrooms, we respond with \nthoughts and prayers instead of smarter policies or stronger laws. We \nare asked to simply accept this bloodshed as an unavoidable fact of \nAmerican life.\n  Not anymore.\n  How about this? Let's reform our background check system. Let's ban \nassault rifles and keep weapons of war out of our communities. Then, if \npeople are truly desperate to fire those types of weapons, they can do \nwhat I did: go to www.marines.mil and enlist.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n"], "Mr. SUOZZI": ["2018-01-09", "  Mr. SUOZZI.

They have done so in the face \nof violent repression, imprisonment, torture, and even death.\n  Why?\n  They are fed up. They are fed up with poverty and unemployment; fed \nup with economic depravation and rampant corruption; fed up with an \noppressive theocratic regime that mismanages their own country, \nmistreats its own people, and spends billions of dollars sowing the \nseeds of war and funding terrorists while its people suffer.\n  Ayatollahs recklessly pursued nuclear weapons instead of creating \njobs and building infrastructure for their own people. The regime's \napologists have long argued that these policies are popular and they \ngive Iranians a national sense of pride, restoring their place as a \nregional power.\n  A regional power?\n  It is more like regional thugs.\n  In Iraq, Iranian-backed militias have executed and beat civilians, \nlooted homes, and destroyed people's lives.

While she currently \nserves as the Chief Officer of Strategic Communication and Development \nfor Christiana Care Health System, many in my state know Drew not for \nany title she has held, but for her role as a trailblazer on any number \nof important public policy fronts.\n   Drew is an attorney by trade and applied her skills as the executive \ndirector of the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware. During her \ntime at the ACLU, Drew fought for improvements to the child welfare \nsystem, the criminal justice system, and LGBT rights. She, along with \nher equally distinguished wife Lisa, helped spearhead the Equality \nDelaware campaign, which saw Delaware go from a state which legally \npermitted discrimination against LGBT citizens, to a state with full \nmarriage equality in a span of less than a decade.\n   Drew applied her years of experience and extensive knowledge of the \ncriminal justice system as the executive director of the Delaware \nCriminal Justice Council. Drew then took her work from the CJC to the \nGovernor's Office, where she served as Deputy Chief of Staff and \neventually Chief of Staff to former Delaware Governor Jack Markell.\n   Throughout her time in Delaware government, her colleagues came to \nknow her as one of the most effective advocates around. She did it all \nwith a warm smile and a reassuring hand on the shoulder. She endured \nbigotry and ignorance while maintaining class and composure, all the \nwhile, making remarkable progress for the people of Delaware.\n   Mr. Speaker, it gives me great joy to rise today to recognize Drew \nnot only as a constituent, but as a friend and confidant. Her work in \nDelaware has been truly transformational and I'm confident it is \nnowhere near complete. Drew will soon be the 2018 Girl Scouts of the \nChesapeake Bay Woman of Distinction.

Unfortunately, with this decision, we have seen the number \nof abortions occurring in the United States growing each year. \nAccording to Planned Parenthood's 2016-2017 annual report, abortions \nmake up 96 percent of the organization's pregnancy resolution services, \nwhereas prenatal services dropped significantly.\n  Additionally, Planned Parenthood has performed more than 1.6 million \nabortions over the past 5 years. Now, more than ever, it is crucial \nthat we celebrate the sanctity of life by encouraging and supporting \npro-life legislation. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, \nwhich I am a proud cosponsor of, affirmatively states that if a baby is \nborn after a failed abortion attempt, doctors must exercise the same \ndegree of medical care on that child as a baby born on any other day.\n  If doctors refuse to do so, they will be held criminally accountable \nfor their actions.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues from Montana and \nHawaii for their supportiveness.\n  Briefly, Mr. Speaker, this is what you get when people talk about \nissues and not cliches. This is a long time in the making, as has been \npreviously indicated, folks from the wilderness areas, folks from \neconomic development areas, folks from the resource extraction areas \nall coming together on this.\n  But just in case there is some concern about, oh my God, potentially \nwe are transferring the Federal estate, let's remind people of a couple \nof things that are in this legislation.\n  First of all, nothing is transferred for nothing. It talks about the \nappraisal process and how, if you are going to purchase the Federal \nestate, you are going to pay for it.\n  Secondly, it is talking about exchanges along the Trans-Pacific \nlegislation on the checkerboard from 1862, which talks about the \nSecretary of the Interior is a full partner with the county commission \nin identifying those lands that are appropriate for exchange.\n  Why is this important?\n  This is important because if they don't think it is a good idea to \nexchange, then the Secretary of the Interior can stop that process, so \nit doesn't force the Secretary of the Interior to exchange land that he \nor she, in the future, doesn't want to.\n  But let's remind ourselves of one other thing. Exchanges of \ncheckerboard land are not just something that benefits perhaps economic \ndevelopment along the Interstate 80 corridor, or somebody who does a \ncow-calf operation somewhere. It also allows resource managers, Federal \nland managers, wildlife people to consolidate checkerboard lands where \nthey need to be consolidated, to do things like preserve habitat, \npreserve special resource areas, whether it is for mule deer, whether \nit is for the endangered species potential of the sage hen, and other \nthings like that. So it is a two-way street.\n  So my congratulations to the folks of Pershing County and the BLM \nemployees in the Winnemucca district.\n  By the way, no lands are subject to this that haven't been identified \nin their resource management plan, their planning document, as \npotentially available for either exchange or disposal.\n  Finally, I want to remind you of this: there are 150,000 acres that \ncan be bought out of a potential Federal estate of over 9 million acres \nin that county. So it is a fraction of 1 percent. And of the potential \navailable for exchange, it sets an upper limit of 300,000, potential. \nThe county has to ask for it, the Secretary has to agree to an \nexchange.\n  So when you talk about the size of the Federal estate in Pershing \nCounty--which, by the way, is the home to the Burning Man festival, for \nthose of you who follow that sort of stuff--it is something that is, \nquite frankly, not going to change the landscape, literally speaking, \nin terms of the ownership and the diminishment of the Federal estate. \nThey are still the major player to the tune of--at the end of the day, \n95 percent of the Federal estate is still intact.\n  Finally, on wilderness study areas and wilderness creation areas, in \nthis bill, you have created about 148,000 acres of new wilderness areas \nand you have released parts of five different wilderness study areas \nthat are about 48,000 acres. So when you start talking about this is a \ngood housekeeping measure, it allows Pershing County to come into the \nnew age in terms of what they think is appropriate for their economic \ndiversification and vitality, but also gives Federal land managers, \nresource folks, wildlife groups, and conservation groups, the tools to \ndo good things in Pershing County, too.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his generous provision \nof the time.\n  The last piece is this: the most successful public lands legislation \nin the country is probably the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management \nAct, which turns 20 this year. Much of this is patterned on that.\n  When you talk about what happens when they sell land, money goes to \neducation and it goes to the county, and then 85 percent of every \ndollar brought in goes for the benefit of those Federal lands, for \nthose land managers in Pershing County.\n\n\n  It has been working in southern Nevada for 20 years.

Songwriters from my district have voiced that it is nearly \nimpossible to earn a fair income via digital streaming. They are \nusually not the famous performers and cannot go on tour to earn a \nliving.\n  Over 50 percent of their income is derived from licensing performance \nrights to their music. One of my constituents, Michelle Lewis, shared \nthat she made just $3.78 for 1.3 million streams of her work on one \nstreaming service.

Jones, \nand their family are known in the Marianas and throughout the Western \nPacific for their successes in business. They are also known for the \nvision and heart with which they have used their personal successes for \nthe benefit of the communities where they live and do business.\n  Born in North Carolina, Robert (``Bob'') Jones moved to Guam in 1957 \nto work for the company his brother Kenneth had started--Jones & \nGuerrero, Incorporated. Bob would work alongside Ken for the next 24 \nyears, rising to be Executive Vice President and Chief Operating \nOfficer of the company.\n  In 1984, though, he struck out on his own and established Triple J \nEnterprises on Guam, a reference to the Jones' three children--Julie, \nJeff and Jay. Starting with a Subaru distributorship he bought from Ken \nthe company did well, later venturing up two years later to Saipan in \nthe Northern Mariana Islands.\n  From the inception, it was a family business: Margaret did the \nbuying, handled advertising and public relations, and was the company \ntreasurer. Sister Georgia J. Stafford also lent\n\n\na hand when needed; and the children helped out cleaning cars and \nworking in the parts and service departments.\n  At first, Triple J distributed Subaru automobiles, Hino heavy trucks \nand buses, and Bluebird school buses. As business grew they added the \nFord, Mazda, Lincoln, Hyundai, Isuzu, Suzuki, Volvo, Honda, Acura, Kia \nand Mitsubishi brands to the company's automobile business portfolio. \nAnd when the children returned from college the business began \nexpanding beyond automobiles and beyond Guam and the Northern Marianas.\n  In 1987, in alignment with Bob's visionary persona, Triple J began \nworking in wholesale foods and retail grocery with a business on Ebeye \nin the Marshall Islands. Further expansion years later added nearby \nMajuro, where the company today continues to operate similar \nbusinesses. In 1998, the wholesale business would expand west to Palau \nalong with a bakery, convenience store, and Shell service station.\n  Triple J would further diversify into the restaurant business \nbeginning in the mid-1990s with the purchase of an Outback Steakhouse \nfranchise on Guam and, later, Tony Roma's, Capricciosa, Bubba Gump \nShrimp Company, and Great Harvest Bakery franchises on Saipan. \nScheduled to open in 2019, a Red Lobster franchise restaurant now under \ndevelopment on Guam will be a new addition to the restaurant group.\n  In 1994, Triple J had a hand in negotiating the arrival of K-Mart on \nGuam. That store, bucking a national trend of closures, remains to this \nday one of the most successful K-Marts anywhere.\n  Into the new millennium, by 2005 Triple J had grown to be the fourth \nlargest business in Micronesia, as ranked by the Guam Business \nMagazine. The Guam Chamber of Commerce named the company Business \nLaureate of the Year and inducted Triple J into the Guam Business Hall \nof Fame--the youngest corporation to receive the honor.\n  And they just kept growing. Triple J acquired Hertz Rent-a-Car rights \nand became exclusive distributor in all of Micronesia for Solahart--an \nAustralian solar water heater company.\n  Capitalizing on another opportunity, Triple J developed a first-of-\nits-kind affordable housing development on Saipan, subsidized by the \nU.S. Treasury's Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program. Sandy Beach \nHomes--a $27 million, 60-unit project--was completed in late 2011; and \na second, affordable housing project--Saipan Comfort Homes--quickly \nfollowed with another 40 units.\n  Sharing in the value of philanthropy, the Jones family and Triple J \nmake efforts to enhance the quality of life of those in need. On Guam, \nTriple J partners with the American Cancer Society Guam Chapter \nannually to support their signature funding event, Relay for Life, \nraising as much as $40,000 in one year alone. In the Northern Marianas, \nthe company regularly contributes to the Red Cross Walk-a-Thon, the \nMarianas March Against Cancer, Make-A-Wish Foundation, and numerous \nother charitable programs raising money for relief efforts and cancer \nresearch. They have also been the official car sponsor of the Miss \nMarianas Pageant and the Northern Mariana Islands Football Association.\n  This larger concern for the welfare of the whole community came into \nfurther relief when the Marianas was hit by Typhoon Soudelor in 2015. \nThe worst typhoon in decades, Soudelor carried sustained winds \nexceeding 100 miles per hour. In the wake of the devastation, which \nleft most people on Saipan without power for a month, Bob Jones donated \nthousands of dollars in food to help the Salvation Army set up a hot \nmeals program in Kagman, one of the hardest-hit villages. For his \nselflessness and support, when the community was in dire need, the \nRotary Club of Saipan awarded Bob Jones its Citizen of the Year award \nin 2016.\n  ``Customers first'' is Triple J's simple mission statement and yet, \nit holds a more complex meaning displayed in the actions behind their \nsuccesses. That people-centric view serves as a model to other \nbusinesses in the communities they serve.\n  Through all these years of dynamic growth, the importance of family \nremains central to the successes of Bob and Margaret. Son Jeffery is \nthe president and chief operating officer of the company. Son Jay is \nsenior vice president with a focus on automotive operations. And, while \ndaughter Julie spends much of her time in a professional counseling \npractice, her husband, Dan Murrell, serves as senior vice president in \ncharge of real estate, food, and restaurant operations. Mother Margaret \nremains company treasurer. Bob is chairman and CEO. Growing into the \nthird generation, five of their eleven grandchildren have begun working \nfor the family business. Today, the Triple J group employs over 900 \nemployees across the Micronesia region, many of whom have been with the \nbusiness for twenty plus years.\n  Please join me in thanking and congratulating true citizens of the \nMarianas, Bob and Margaret Jones and all their family for over 60 years \nof service and success in the Marianas and throughout Micronesia.\n"], "The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Perry)": ["2017-07-12", "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Perry).

The consequences can be dire, and \nthat is why the Congressional Black Caucus and the Health Brain Trust \nof the Congressional Black Caucus have made these a priority in our \nagenda over the years under the leadership of the gentlewoman from \nChicago, Illinois (Ms. Kelly).\n\n\n  People with sickle cell disease have a much shorter life expectancy, \nwith median ages of death for males of only 33 years and for females of \nonly 36 years. These patients are also more likely to have additional \nhealth complications, including stroke, blood clots, loss of vision, \nand lung and kidney failure.\n  There are approximately 4,400 people with sickle cell disease in \nNorth Carolina. I am sure that, Mr. Speaker, in the State of Texas, it \nmay be even more. My hope is that someday there will be none.\n  That is why we must reauthorize the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment \nDemonstration Program to enable the Secretary of HHS to support \nresearch to increase our understanding of the disease, and create a \ngrant program to study the prevalence of sickle cell and identify ways \nto prevent and treat sickle cell disease effectively.\n  Sixty-five percent of individuals with this disease in North Carolina \nhave at least one emergency room visit per year. That is no way to \nlive. I am sure Dr. Burgess, when he practiced medicine in his home \nState, saw many, many patients who were similarly situated.\n  We should do all that we can to help improve patients' lives, advance \ntreatment, and find a cure. I am grateful for the opportunity to move \nthis bill through the House, and I hope that my colleagues will join me \nin supporting it.\n  I thank Dr. Burgess, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Green for their work.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and applaud Robert \nHolden, a member of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Tribes, who joined the \nstaff of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) in 1984 and \nretired last December after 33 years of dedicated service to NCAI and \nto the millions of Native people that were foremost in his mind every \nday of his life.\n  Many of you know that NCAI was begun in 1944 at the peak of the \nFederal government's ``Termination Policy,'' which sought to dissolve \nIndian tribal governments and to assimilate Indian people into the \nmainstream of America. Today, NCAI is the oldest, largest and most \nrepresentative tribal organization in the country, with more than 300 \nmember tribes.\n  When people in Congress or in public want to gauge the views of \nIndian Country on matters of health care, housing, cultural issues, \neconomic development or sovereignty, they turn to NCAI.\n  For more than three decades, these people have often talked to Robert \nwho spent most of his career at NCAI when salaries were low, there was \nno proper retirement program or health care, and with few staff. This \nmeant long days, evenings and weekends, travel away from home and \nfamily, and often-frustrating times getting the attention of decision-\nmakers in Congress and Federal agencies.\n  Working under the leadership of at least 6 Executive Directors, \nRobert became, over time, the institutional and collective memory of \nthe NCAI organization as well as the source of continuity that is so \nimportant to a membership organization like NCAI.\n\n\n  None of these challenges could prevent Robert from persisting in his \nlife's work and his absolute dedication to the cause of tribal \nsovereignty and improving the lives of Indian people.\n  Robert's leadership and commitment to the mission of NCAI stabilized \nthe organization through many internal changes and external challenges.\n  Robert's work for NCAI over the years has been varied and compelling.\n  In the 1990's he managed the Nuclear Waste Policy Committee for NCAI \non a contract with the U.S. Department of Energy, which anchored the \norganization's finances during a very difficult period. By identifying \nother contract and grant opportunities, Robert generated millions of \ndollars to NCAI, making possible the good work of the organization over \nthe years.\n  Robert had great success on policy issues--particularly emergency \nresponse and tribal-friendly amendments to the Stafford Act, which he \nlabored on for more than two decades. His efforts bore fruit when a \nwindow of opportunity opened after Hurricane Sandy and, as was typical \nof his work ethic, Robert jumped in with both feet. This is a prime \nexample of Robert's patient but steady vision and how his long-term \ncommitment has benefitted not just NCAI but tribal communities across \nthe United States.\n  Robert is also leaving a legacy from his work with Native Veterans: \nhis accomplishments include the recent decision by the Veterans \nAdministration to expand the Tribal Veterans Service Officers Program; \nNative Code Talker legislation; and the establishment and funding of \nthe National Indian Veterans Memorial, which will be housed on the \ngrounds of the National Museum of the American Indian.\n  As a strong supporter and advocate for Native political \nparticipation, Robert pressed for increased voter awareness and action \nin Native communities even before the ``Native Vote'' phenomenon took \nshape.\n  In all of Robert's work, his fundamental belief in the wisdom of \nIndian people and the capacity of tribal governments to take on \nchallenges of increasing technical complexity before long was one of \nthe anchors of the Tribal Self-Governance movement, particularly in law \nenforcement and public safety.\n  Robert Holden may have retired, but he is not going away. He plans to \nserve as an Ambassador at Large for NCAI, continuing to participate in \nNCAI gatherings, and continuing to serve the Indian people and our \ncountry as he has done his whole adult life.\n  In 2017, the NCAI's member tribes unanimously passed Resolution MKE-\n17-027 titled ``Appreciation for Robert Holden.'' Therefore, I include \nthis Resolution in the Record.\n  I am grateful to Robert for his life's dedication to these important \nmatters and for his indomitable spirit in making sure Indian tribes \nwere always part of the discussion here in the halls of power in \nWashington, D.C.\n  I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in wishing Robert all the \nbest in whatever the Creator has in store for him in the years to come.\n\n                     Appreciation for Robert Holden\n\n\n               The National Congress of American Indians\n\n       Whereas, We, the members of the National Congress of \n     American Indians of the United States, invoking the divine \n     blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and purposes, in \n     order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the \n     inherent sovereign rights of our Indian nations, rights \n     secured under Indian treaties and agreements with the United \n     States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are \n     entitled under the laws and Constitution of the United States \n     and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of \n     Indigenous Peoples, to enlighten the public toward a better \n     understanding of the Indian people, to preserve Indian \n     cultural values, and otherwise promote the health, safety and \n     welfare of the Indian people, do hereby establish and submit \n     the following resolution; and\n       Whereas, The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) \n     was established in 1944 and is the oldest and largest \n     national organization of American Indian and Alaska Native \n     tribal governments; and\n       Whereas, Robert Holden, the Deputy Director of NCAI, is \n     preparing for a well-deserved retirement; and\n       Whereas, Robert started at NCAI in 1984 and for 33 years \n     has graciously shared his tenacity, resilience, intelligence \n     and compassion to make lasting change for tribal nations; and\n       Whereas, Robert's leadership and commitment to the mission \n     of NCAI has stabilized the organization through many internal \n     and external changes; and\n       Whereas, For more than a decade Robert managed the \n     important National Indian Nuclear Waste Policy Committee, \n     with Russell Jim of the Yakama Nation serving as Chairman, at \n     a time when Congress was considering the creation of a \n     geologic repository at Yucca Mountain and the movement of \n     significant amounts of high-level nuclear waste across many \n     reservations; and\n       Whereas, Robert Holden has been a leader in promoting \n     emergency and radiological preparedness and transportation \n     safety and urged proactive steps to address impacts on Indian \n     tribes and provide emergency response capabilities; and\n       Whereas, Robert Holden's work led directly to the Stafford \n     Act amendments authorizing Indian tribes, as sovereigns, to \n     make disaster declarations directly to the President of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, Robert has been consistently committed to working \n     with Native Veterans, and the expansion of tribal veterans \n     services and Robert has kept forth issues such as the Native \n     Code Talker Bill and a National Indian Veterans Memorial, and \n     fought to keep the Veterans Committee going for every veteran \n     to attend at no cost; and\n       Whereas, Robert has maintained exemplary commitment to \n     voting participation in Indian Country; and\n       Whereas, In all of Robert's work, his support for the \n     capacity of tribal government to take on challenges of \n     increasing technical complexity has been one of the anchors \n     of the SelfGovernance movement, particularly in law \n     enforcement and public safety; and\n       Whereas, Robert has developed and maintained hundreds of \n     relationships with tribal leaders from around Indian country, \n     building trust with NCAI; and\n       Whereas, Robert plans to continue as an ambassador for \n     NCAI, participating in the NCAI gatherings, continuing his \n     lifelong commitment to advancing tribal sovereignty, treaty \n     rights, and the federal trust responsibility; and\n       Whereas, words cannot capture the immeasurable spirit and \n     incomparable contributions of Robert Holden to NCAI and to \n     the whole of Indian Country; Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the National Congress of American Indians \n     (NCAI) expresses deep appreciation, love, gratitude, \n     friendship, and respect for Robert Holden.\n\n"], "The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania)": ["2017-06-15", "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania).

Mr. Chairman, I just want to start off by thanking Chairman \nHensarling and the entire Financial Services Committee for their \nleadership on this vital and important legislation. Job well done.\n  The Financial CHOICE Act answers a deep need at the very heart of our \neconomy. We have heard about this need time and again from our \nconstituents back home. I sure have.\n  Small businesses are struggling. They have been unable to hire, \ninvest, or get the loans that they need to get off the ground. Families \nlooking to keep their money safe are hit with fees that they cannot \nafford.\n  And why is this? Our community banks are in trouble. They are being \ncrushed by the costly rules imposed on them by the Dodd-Frank Act. This \nlaw may have had good intentions, but its consequences have been dire \nfor Main Street.\n  Let me put it this way: It is more than 1,000 pages long and has more \nrules and regulations than any other Obama-era law. The burdens created \nare real and deep.\n  These costs are unsustainable for small community banks who simply \ncannot afford to meet all the requirements and can't hire a team of \nlawyers to decipher the seemingly endless rules.\n  So what do they do? They hunker down. They are unable to loan out \nmoney. Or worse, they are shutting down.\n  The CHOICE Act reins in Dodd-Frank, and it delivers the regulatory \nrelief these small banks so desperately need. This will change our \ncommunities because these banks are the lifeblood of our Main Streets.\n  Where I come from, representing towns small and medium, they are not \nbig companies in big cities getting money from big banks. They are \nsmall- and medium-size businesses in small- and medium-size towns \nhoping the community banker will be able to give them the loan they \nneed to hire some people, to take a risk, to start a small business, to \nexpand their small business. They know the needs of their communities, \nand they are able to identify the people who can fill those needs \nsuccessfully.\n  There is a reason why they handle the vast majority of small-business \nloans in this country: because they are the ones who are the closest to \nthe small businesses.\n  Here is the difference: The people big banks may overlook thinking it \nis some guy with a pipe dream, the community banker is able to \nrecognize that as a father of four with the drive to make his dream of \na bicycle shop into a reality or a woman seeking to rent out retail \nspace to open her dream restaurant using her family recipes, or maybe \nit is a young farmer with a new idea to integrate the latest technology \ninto the family farm. The big banks don't pay attention to that; only \ncommunity banks do.\n  A couple of years later, with the help of these kinds of loans from \nthese local banks, these so-called pipe dreams in these small towns and \nthese rural counties become successful businesses. They become job \ncreators. These are the ultimate success stories that our communities \nin America are built upon.\n  This is why the Financial CHOICE Act is so important. It helps \ncommunity banks and the small businesses that absolutely depend on \nthem, it helps them thrive. It protects consumers by increasing \naccountability and transparency over the wider financial sector, and it \nalso repeals ``too big to fail,'' the rules codified by Dodd-Frank that \nhave left taxpayers on the\n\n\nhook for too long. Ultimately, the Financial CHOICE Act is a jobs bill, \nand it is one that will bring hope back to Main Street.\n  It is easy to talk about the economy and regulations as a series of \nnumbers. It is easy to talk in vague terms about job creators and \nsmall-business owners. But what is far more important is identifying \nthe problems that they actually face and actually doing something about \nthose problems to help make a difference to improve their lives.\n  That is what this CHOICE Act is all about. It is why we were sent \nhere: to look out for the people who work hard and who do the right \nthing.\n  Let's get this done for them. Let's get this done for the people who \ntake the risks, who live and breathe their work, for the people who \nstrive and struggle every day for their families.

Mr. Speaker, last week's shooting in \nAlexandria left our friend and colleague Mr. Steve Scalise badly \nwounded. Two brave U.S. Capitol Police officers and a young \ncongressional staffer were also injured. We continue to pray for their \nquick and their full recovery.\n  I know that other Members, other staff members, their friends, their \nfamilies have been affected by this, too. Too often, after a shooting \nor some other traumatic event, we focus on those injuries that are \nphysical, the ones we can see, while forgetting about those injuries we \ncan't see.\n  I continue to practice psychology in the Navy at Walter Reed Hospital \nin Bethesda, where I work with veterans who suffer from post-traumatic \nstress disorder, or PTSD, and traumatic brain injury. These veterans \ncome back from witnessing traumatic events while in combat, and some \nhave come close to committing suicide. These brave men and women fight \nevery day against the horrific images that replay in their minds. The \nwound is invisible; the damage is often long term. They can and do \nrecover with help.\n  Since last week, I have thought about other groups who witness trauma \nin their homes and in their neighborhoods. These are the forgotten \nones: young kids in Chicago who have become desensitized to the sound \nof a gunshot or the sounds of police sirens throughout the night, \nvictims of sexual assault on college campuses and elsewhere, children \nwho witness domestic abuse, and youth in foster care.\n  Most youth in foster care have traumatic family histories and life \nexperiences, including their removal from the birth family, resulting \nin an increased risk for mental health disorders. A recent study \npublished in Pediatrics found that children placed in foster care were \nthree to five times more likely to suffer from mental health problems \nsuch as depression and attention deficit disorder than children who \nwere never in foster care.\n  Another study revealed that PTSD was diagnosed 60 percent of the time \nin sexually abused children and 42 percent of the time in physically \nabused children. A staggering 18 percent of foster children have never \nbeen the primary victim of abuse, yet they still suffer from PTSD \nprobably because they witnessed domestic or community violence.\n  The American Academy of Pediatrics Healthy Foster Care America \ninitiative identifies mental and behavioral health as the ``greatest \nunmet health need for children and teens in foster care.'' And since \nmost of these kids are not receiving mental health treatment, their \nproblems carry on into adulthood.\n  Adults who formerly were placed in foster care, known as foster care \nalumni, have disproportionately high rates of emotional and behavioral \ndisorders; 21.5 percent of foster care alumni suffer from PTSD compared \nto just 4.5 percent of the general population.\n  Each year more than 20,000 young people age out of foster care \nwithout being ready to live independently. Discharged from care without \nsocial support or assistance, these youth are at higher risk for drug \nuse and mental illness, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress, \nand others. Too often they experience higher rates of unemployment, \nhomelessness, and dependence on public assistance programs.\n  A lack of a comprehensive mental health screening of all children \nentering out-of-home care and the need for more thorough identification \nof youth with emotional and behavioral disorders contribute to these \ndismal statistics. As well, insufficient youth access to high-quality \nmental health services highlights our Nation's shortage of providers, \nin that half the counties in America have no psychologists, no \npsychiatrists, no clinical social workers, or workers who are licensed \nas substance abuse providers.\n  Given the evidence from studies indicating that children in care have \nsignificant developmental, behavioral, and emotional problems, quality \nservices for these children are an essential societal investment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud that the House yesterday took up legislation \nto address this important issue. H.R. 2847, the Improving Services for \nOlder Youth in Foster Care Act, expands and improves the John H. Chafee \nIndependence Program, which helps current and former foster care youth \nachieve self-sufficiency. Specifically, the bill will widen the age \nrange of foster youth who can receive assistance under the program.\n  I am proud to support this bill and will continue to shed light on \nthose who suffer from trauma, who, as a consequence, suffer from either \nPTSD, depression, or other emotional sequelae. These bills we voted on \nwill continue to give our foster children both help and hope.\n"], "Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida": ["2018-03-06", "  Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, when you drive through \nFlorida's heartland in Highlands County, you will probably see signs \nthat say ``Kahn Groves,'' and then you will drive through miles of \ncitrus groves.\n  Marvin Kahn has been a passionate advocate for citrus over the last \nfive decades, leading his management company from managing 400 acres to \nover 5,500 acres at its peak.\n  Mr. Kahn is one of the State's most innovative growers, caretakers, \nand marketers. He served on the Florida Citrus Commission for 8 years \nand worked on the long-range planning committee for several years after \nthat. His devotion to Florida citrus and agriculture was real, and he \ndid everything he could to share his passion with others, especially \nwith young people.\n  Each year, the Florida Citrus Hall of Fame honors the most \ndistinguished leaders who have made significant contributions to the \nFlorida citrus industry, and there is no one more deserving of a spot \non that hall of fame than Mr. Marvin Kahn. When it comes to serving \nFlorida's agriculture industry, his passion for Florida's citrus is \nunparalleled.\n  Florida is a better place because of Mr. Kahn, and it has been an \nhonor to serve him in the House of Representatives.\n"], "The PRESIDENT": ["2018-01-30", "  The PRESIDENT. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, \nthe First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:\n  Less than 1 year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in \nthis majestic Chamber, to speak on behalf of the American people and to \naddress their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our \nnew administration had already taken very swift action. A new tide of \noptimism was already sweeping across our land.\n  Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a \nrighteous mission: to make America great again for all Americans.\n  Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved \nextraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others \nwe could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory \nand the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. \nBut through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul and the \nsteel in America's spine.\n  Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are and \nshow us what we can be.\n  We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing to the rescue with \ntheir fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally \ndevastating hurricane.\n  We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the \nLas Vegas strip.\n  We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee \nLeppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was \naboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during \nHurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live \npower lines and deep water to help save more than 40 lives.\n  Ashlee, we all thank you. Thank you very much.\n  We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He is here \nwith us also. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 \nchildren trapped at a California summer camp\n\n\nthreatened by those devastating wildfires\n  To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto \nRico, and the Virgin Islands--and everywhere--we are with you, we love \nyou, and we always will pull through together. Always.\n  Thank you to David and the brave people of California. Thank you very \nmuch, David. Great job.\n  Some trials over the past year touched this Chamber very personally. \nWith us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this \nHouse, a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work 3\\1/\n2\\ months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise.\n  I think they like you, Steve.\n  We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol \nPolice officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and \nparamedics who saved his life and the lives of many others--some in \nthis room.\n  In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together not as \nRepublicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it \nis not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I \ncall upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common \nground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This \nis really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve.\n  Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no \npeople on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined, as \nAmericans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, \nwe cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an \nopportunity, we seize it.\n  So let's begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is \nstrong because our people are strong. And, together, we are building a \nsafe, strong, and proud America.\n  Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including \n200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. Tremendous numbers. After \nyears and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.\n  Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. And something I am very \nproud of: African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever \nrecorded, and Hispanic-American unemployment has also reached the \nlowest levels in history.\n  Small business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market \nhas smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion, and more, in \nvalue in just this short period of time. That is great news for \nAmericans. 401(k), retirement, pension, and college savings accounts \nhave gone through the roof.\n  And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months \nago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.\n  Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class \nand small businesses.\n  To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the \nstandard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a \nmarried couple is completely tax free. We also doubled the child tax \ncredit.\n  A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill \nreduced by $2,000--slashing their tax bill in half.\n  In April, this will be the last time you will ever file under the \nold, and very broken, system; and millions of Americans will have more \ntake-home pay starting next month--a lot more.\n  We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans \nmaking less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous \npenalties, simply because they couldn't afford government-ordered \nhealth plans. We repealed the core of the disastrous ObamaCare. The \nindividual mandate is now gone.\n  We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to \n21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone \nelse anywhere in the world. These changes alone are estimated to \nincrease average family income by more than $4,000--a lot of money.\n  Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut and can now \ndeduct 20 percent of their business income.\n  Here, tonight, are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub \nManufacturing--a small, beautiful business in Ohio. They have just \nfinished the best year in their 20-year history. Because of tax reform, \nthey are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and \nexpanding into the building next door--a good feeling.\n  One of Staub's employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey \nis an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, \nlost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, \nwhere he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, \nCorey plans to invest his tax-cut raise into his new home and his two \ndaughters' educations. Corey, please stand. And he is a great welder. I \nwas told that by the man who owns that company that is doing so well. \nSo, congratulations, Corey.\n  Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already \ngotten tax-cut bonuses--many of them thousands and thousands of dollars \nper worker; and it is getting more every month, every week. Apple has \njust announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America \nand hire another 20,000 workers. And just a little while ago, \nExxonMobil announced a $50 billion investment in the United States--\njust a little while ago.\n  This, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a \nbetter time to start living the American Dream.\n  So to every citizen watching at home tonight--no matter where you \nhave been or where you have come from--this is your time. If you work \nhard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you \ncan dream anything, you can be anything, and, together, we can achieve \nabsolutely anything.\n  Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to \nhave and what kind of a nation we are going to be. All of us, together, \nas one team, one people, and one American family can do anything.\n  We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the \nsame great American flag.\n  Together, we are rediscovering the American way.\n  In America, we know that faith and family, not government and \nbureaucracy, are the center of American life. Our motto is ``In God We \nTrust.''\n  And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans \nas heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.\n  Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, \nCalifornia, who noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with \nflags on Veterans Day. He decided all by himself to change that and \nstarted a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of \nour great heroes. Preston: a job well done.\n  Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as \nAmericans. And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something \nvery special; that, I can tell you. Great future. Thank you very much \nfor all you have done, Preston. Thank you very much.\n  Preston's reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us \nof why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the \nPledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.\n  Americans love their country, and they deserve a government that \nshows them the same love and loyalty in return.\n  For the last year, we have sought to restore the bonds of trust \nbetween our citizens and their government. Working with the Senate, we \nare appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, \nincluding a great new Supreme Court Justice and more circuit court \njudges than any new administration in the history of our country.\n  We are totally defending our Second Amendment and have taken historic \nactions to protect religious liberty.\n  And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans \nchoice in their healthcare decisions. Last year, Congress also passed, \nand I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my \nadministration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who \nfailed to give our veterans the care they deserve, and we are hiring \ntalented people who love our vets as much as we do. And I will not stop \nuntil our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my \npromise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.\n  All Americans deserve accountability and respect, and that is what we \nare\n\n\ngiving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. Thank you.\n  So tonight I call on Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with \nthe authority to reward good workers and to remove Federal employees \nwho undermine the public trust or fail the American people.\n  In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more \nregulations in our first year than any administration in the history of \nour country.\n  We have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war \non beautiful, clean coal. We are now, very proudly, an exporter of \nenergy to the world.\n  In Detroit, I halted government mandates that crippled America's \ngreat, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get Motor City revving its \nengines again, and that is what is happening.\n  Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the \nUnited States, something we haven't seen for decades. Chrysler is \nmoving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan. Toyota and Mazda are \nopening up a plant in Alabama--a big one--and we haven't seen this in a \nlong time. It is all coming back. Very soon, auto plants and other \nplants will be opening up all over our country.\n  This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For \nmany years, companies and jobs were only leaving us, but now they are \nroaring back. They are coming back. They want to be where the action \nis. They want to be in the United States of America. That is where they \nwant to be.\n  Exciting progress is happening every single day.\n  To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, \nlast year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical \ndevices than ever before in our country's history.\n  We also believe that patients with terminal conditions and terminal \nillness should have access to experimental treatment immediately that \ncould potentially save their lives.\n  People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to \ncountry to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance right here at \nhome. It is time for Congress to give these wonderful, incredible \nAmericans the ``right to try.''\n  One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription \ndrugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we \npay in the United States, and it is very, very unfair. That is why I \nhave directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high \ndrug prices one of my top priorities for the year, and prices will come \ndown substantially. Watch.\n  America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade \ndeals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, \nour jobs, and our wealth. Our Nation has lost its wealth, but we are \ngetting it back so fast.\n  The era of economic surrender is totally over.\n  From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and, very \nimportantly, reciprocal.\n  We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones, and they \nwill be good ones, but they will be fair.\n  And we will protect American workers and American intellectual \nproperty through strong enforcement of our trade rules.\n  As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our \ncrumbling infrastructure.\n  America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building \nin just 1 year. Isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just \nto get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road?\n  I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, \nreliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our \npeople deserve.\n  Tonight, I am calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at \nleast $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our \ncountry so desperately needs.\n  Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and \nlocal governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector \ninvestment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit, and we can do \nit.\n  Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, \ngetting it down to no more than 2 years, and perhaps even 1.\n  Together, we can reclaim our great building heritage. We will build \ngleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all \nacross our land, and we will do it with American heart and American \nhands and American grit.\n  We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day's work. We \nwant every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every \ncitizen to be proud of this land that we all love so much.\n  We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to \nindependence, and from poverty to prosperity.\n  As tax cuts create new jobs, let's invest in workforce development \nand let's invest in job training, which we need so badly. Let's open \ngreat vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and \nrealize their full potential. And let's support working families by \nsupporting paid family leave.\n  As America regains its strength, opportunity must be extended to all \ncitizens. That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons \nto help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance \nat life.\n  Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also \nbe helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of \nAmerican workers and American families.\n  For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into \nour most vulnerable communities. They have allowed millions of low-wage \nworkers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. \nMost tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.\n  Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, \nFreddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two \nteenage daughters, Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens, were close friends on \nLong Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th birthday, \nsuch a happy time it should have been, neither of them came home. These \ntwo precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in \ntheir hometown. Six members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged \nwith Kayla's and Nisa's murders. Many of these gang members took \nadvantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as \nillegal, unaccompanied alien minors, and wound up in Kayla's and Nisa's \nhigh school.\n  Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight, everyone in this \nChamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. \nPlease stand. Thank you very much. I want you to know that 320 million \nhearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you. While we \ncannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make sure that \nother families never have to endure this kind of pain.\n  Tonight I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly \nloopholes that have allowed MS-13 and other criminal gangs to break \ninto our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our \nimmigration laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents. These \nare great people. These are great, great people who work so hard in the \nmidst of such danger so that this can never happen again.\n  The United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do \nmore than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, \nthe struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as \nPresident of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest \ncompassion, my constant concern, is for America's children, America's \nstruggling workers, and America's forgotten communities. I want our \nyouth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their \nchance to rise.\n  So tonight I am extending an open hand to work with Members of both \nparties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every \nbackground, color, religion, and creed. My duty and the sacred duty of \nevery elected official in this Chamber is to defend Americans, to \nprotect their safety, their families, their communities, and their \nright to the American Dream, because Americans are dreamers, too.\n  Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country: \nHomeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez. He \ngoes by DJ and CJ.\n\n\n  He said: Call me either one.\n  So we will call you CJ.\n  He served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and \nspending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous \ncriminals off of our streets. Tough job.\n  At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ's murder, and they wanted it \nto happen quickly. But he did not cave to threats or to fear. Last May, \nhe commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. \nHis team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 MS-13 gang \nmembers.\n  And I have to tell you what the Border Patrol and ICE have done. We \nhave sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13, horrible \npeople out of this country or into our prisons.\n  So I just want to congratulate you, CJ. You are a brave guy. Thank \nyou very much.\n  And I asked CJ: What is the secret?\n  He said: ``We are just tougher than they are.''\n  And I like that answer. Now let's get Congress to send you--and all \nof the people in this great Chamber have to do it. We have no choice. \nCJ, we are going to send you reinforcements and we are going to send \nthem to you quickly. It is what you need.\n  Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an \nimmigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met \nextensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan \napproach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we \npresented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by \nboth parties as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything \nthey want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and \nmust have.\n  Here are the four pillars of our plan:\n  The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to \ncitizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by \ntheir parents at a young age. That covers almost three times more \npeople than the previous administration covered. Under our plan, those \nwho meet education and work requirements, and show good moral \ncharacter, will be able to become full citizens of the United States \nover a 12-year period.\n  The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a \ngreat wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like \nCJ to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the \nterrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our \ncountry, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of \ncatch and release.\n  The third pillar ends the visa lottery--a program that randomly hands \nout green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of \nAmerican people. It is time to begin moving toward a merit-based \nimmigration system--one that admits people who are skilled, who want to \nwork, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect \nour country.\n  The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending \nchain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant \ncan bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under \nour plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to \nspouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just \nfor our economy, but for our security and for the future of America.\n  In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible \nby the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these \nprograms present risks we can just no longer afford.\n  It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules and finally \nbring our immigration system into the 21st century.\n  These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one \nthat will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.\n  For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this \nproblem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.\n  Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that \nfulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first. So \nlet's come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.\n  These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis \nof opioid and drug addiction. Never before has it been like it is now. \nIt is terrible, and we have to do something about it.\n  In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per \nday, 7 per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers \nif we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.\n  My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and \nhelping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so \nterribly hurt. The struggle will be long, and it will be difficult; but \nas Americans always do, in the end, we will succeed, and we will \nprevail.\n  As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the \nbest in America.\n  We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets \nfamily of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old and an officer with \nthe Albuquerque Police Department. He is here tonight with his wife, \nRebecca. Thank you, Ryan.\n  Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman \npreparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm \nher unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she didn't know where \nto turn but badly wanted a safe home for her baby. In that moment, Ryan \nsaid he felt God speak to him: You will do it because you can. He heard \nthose words. He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. \nThen he went home to tell his wife, Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed \nto adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope.\n  Ryan and Rebecca, you embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you. \nThank you, Ryan and Rebecca.\n  As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also \nrestoring our strength and standing abroad.\n  Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals \nlike China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and \nour values. In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that \nweakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the \nsurest means to our true and great defense.\n  For this reason, I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense \nsequester and fully fund our great military.\n  As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear \narsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and \nso powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other \nnation or anyone else. Perhaps someday in the future there will be a \nmagical moment when the countries of the world will get together to \neliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet, \nsadly.\n  Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to \nextinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud \nto report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to \n100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in \nIraq and in Syria, and in other locations as well. But there is much \nmore work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is \ndefeated.\n  Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa last \nNovember, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, \nwere on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with \nexplosives so that civilians could return to that city, hopefully soon \nand hopefully safely.\n  Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was \nseverely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the \nbooby-trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building and found \nKenton but in very, very bad shape.\n  He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an \nairway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground \ntransport and maintained artificial respiration through 2\\1/2\\ hours of \nemergency surgery.\n  Kenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin's selfless \nlove for his fellow warrior. Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas. \nRaqqa is liberated. And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \n``V'' for ``valor.'' Staff Sergeant Peck: All of America salutes you.\n  Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are \nevil.\n\n\nWhen possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them. When \nnecessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be \nclear: Terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy \ncombatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the \nterrorists they are.\n  In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of \ndangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield--\nincluding the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, whom we captured, whom we had, \nwhom we released.\n  So today, I am keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to \nwalking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis, who is doing a great \njob--thank you--to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep \nopen the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay.\n  I am asking Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and \nal-Qaida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain \nterrorists--wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them. And in \nmany cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay.\n  At the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan \nhave new rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, \nour military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no \nlonger tell our enemies our plans.\n  Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S. \nSenate just months before: I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of \nIsrael.\n  Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly against America's sovereign right to make this \ndecision. In 2016, American taxpayers generously sent those same \ncountries more than $20 billion in aid.\n  That is why, tonight, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to \nhelp ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American \ninterests and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America.\n  As we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also \nrestoring clarity about our adversaries.\n  When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt \ndictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of \nIran in their courageous struggle for freedom.\n  I am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible \nIran nuclear deal.\n  My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist \nand socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.\n  But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally \nthan the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.\n  North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon \nthreaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to \nprevent that from ever happening.\n  Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only \ninvite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of \npast administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.\n  We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean \nregime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to \nAmerica and to our allies.\n  Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of \nVirginia, and a great student he was. On his way to study abroad in \nAsia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this \nwonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the \nstate. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 \nyears of hard labor before returning him to America last June--horribly \ninjured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his \nreturn.\n  Otto's wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us \ntonight, along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta--\nincredible people. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that \nthreatens our world, and your strength truly inspires us all. Thank you \nvery much. Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto's memory with total \nAmerican resolve.\n  Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of \nthis regime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho. In 1996, Seong-ho was a \nstarving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a \nrailroad car to barter for a few scraps of food which were very hard to \nget. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from \nhunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured \nmultiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His \nbrother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover \nand ate dirt themselves--permanently stunting their own growth. Later, \nhe was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a \nbrief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any \nChristians. He had; and he resolved after that to be free.\n  Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches all across China and \nSoutheast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was \ncaught trying to escape and was tortured to death. Today he lives in \nSeoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North \nKorea what the regime fears most--the truth.\n  Today he has a new leg. But, Seong-ho, I understand you still keep \nthose old crutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great \nsacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Thank you.\n  Seong-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul \nto live in freedom.\n  It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave \nbirth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of \ncolonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was \nhome to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could \nrule themselves, that they could chart their own destiny, and that, \ntogether, they could light up the entire world.\n  That is what our country has always been about. That is what \nAmericans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.\n  Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom. She \nstands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who \nfought and lived and died to protect her--monuments to Washington and \nJefferson, to Lincoln and King.\n  They are memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga--to the \nyoung Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the \nfields beyond, and others who went down in the waters of the Pacific \nand the skies all over Asia.\n  And freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one--this \nCapitol, this living monument. This is the monument to the American \npeople.\n  We are a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all \naround us--defending hope and pride and defending the American way.\n  They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care \nfor our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. They are strong \nmoms and brave kids. They are firefighters, police officers, border \nagents, medics, and marines. But above all else, they are Americans. \nAnd this Capitol, this city, this Nation, belong entirely to them.\n  Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to \nprotect them, and to always be worthy of them.\n  Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of \nscience and discovery, and they forever remind us of what we should \nnever ever forget: the people dreamed this country, the people built \nthis country, and it is the people who are making America great again.\n  As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, \nthere is nothing we cannot achieve.\n  As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, \nand trust in our God, we will never fail. Our families will thrive. Our \npeople will prosper. And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and \nproud and mighty and free.\n  Thank you, and God bless America.\n  Good night.\n  (Applause, the Members rising.)\n  At 10 o'clock and 37 minutes p.m., the President of the United \nStates, accompanied by the committee of escort, retired from the Hall \nof the House of Representatives.\n  The Assistant to the Sergeant at Arms escorted the invited guests \nfrom the Chamber in the following order:\n  The members of the President's Cabinet; the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court; the Dean \nof the Diplomatic Corps."], "Mr. CHAFFETZ": ["2017-01-04", "  Mr. CHAFFETZ.

One of the key ways we carry out this duty is through the \nkey watchdog of the government, the Government Accountability Office. \nThe GAO has a proven track record of excellence, and we rely heavily on \nthis group, thousands of professionals who pour their heart and soul \ninto diving deep into organizations and understanding how they \nfunction. But as this bill states, we need some more openness and \ntransparency.\n  In the past 6 years alone, it has identified more than 200 areas of \nduplication, overlap, and fragmentation. They have made recommendations \non 600 actions to make our government more effective and efficient. We \nneed to listen to them and understand them. We also, I would argue, Mr. \nSpeaker, have a duty and an obligation to give them the tools and \naccess that they need in order to do their jobs even better. We must \nput GAO in the best position possible to rout out and deter waste, \nfraud, and abuse.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to better arm the GAO by clarifying its \nright to access data contained in the National Directory of New Hires. \nThis gives GAO access to the most up-to-date data to ensure Federal \nprogram dollars go to the folks Congress intended to receive them. \nDoing so, we will help GAO better investigate potential fraud and \nimproper payments, including those overextended disability insurance \nprograms. The GAO's objectives are hindered without access to the data, \nand taxpayer dollars are not as well protected.\n  This bill has previously received overwhelming support in the House, \nand it is time for us to finish the job and pass the bill to the Senate \nand get it to the President's desk.\n  On September 16, the House approved this important bill by a vote of \n404-0.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, just months ago, we were debating the so-called Tax Cuts \nand Jobs Act. During that debate, I warned that it was the first of the \nRepublicans' three-step plan to give to the wealthy and make \nhardworking families pay the price.\n  Republicans were successful in enacting step one, the tax scam that \ngave more than 80 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. Just \none company, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, is now pocketing $218 million more \nevery week under this new law. They are not alone. These tax cuts are \nshowering big corporations and Wall Street with taxpayer money at an \nobscene level. That was step one.\n  Step two, exploding our deficits, was confirmed this week by the \nCongressional Budget Office. They concluded that the GOP tax cuts will \nadd nearly $2 trillion to the Federal debt over the next decade.\n  That brings us to step three. Having provided millionaires and big \ncorporations with huge tax cuts that do little to grow our economy, the \nGOP has starved our government of revenues. So, naturally, they are \nusing the resulting deficits as an excuse for massive cuts to programs \nthat millions of Americans rely on, including Medicare, Social \nSecurity, and Medicaid.\n  That is what the amendment we are now considering would do. It would \nput in place a constitutionally mandated process solely designed to \nimpose these extreme cuts. That is because it comes packaged with the \nGOP's new religious belief that tax cuts for the rich will save us all. \nThey believe this despite the fact that history and nearly every \nrespected economist will tell you that the only way we can responsibly \nbalance our budget is to include new revenues.\n  So let's call this balanced budget amendment what it is: a stunt to \ngive Republicans political cover for their deficit-exploding tax scam. \nThe party of so-called fiscal hawks has become the party of fiscal \nhypocrites. They know it, and so do the American people.\n  While this bill may be a political gimmick, it is a dangerous one \nthat will have dire consequences for our economy and American families. \nTo begin with, when in effect, it would require that the entire Federal \nbudget this year be cut by at least 20 percent. That would be not just \nunprecedented, it would be devastating.\n  Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, veterans' healthcare, \ninfrastructure, job training, nutrition assistance, and programs that \nhelp make housing affordable and higher education attainable would all \nbe jeopardized.\n  But that is not all. This amendment would put an intolerable \nfinancial strain on every State in this country, forcing them to do \nmore with less. My State of Kentucky relies on Federal funds to cover \n37 percent of the Commonwealth's budget, including 16 percent of \neducation funding and 32 percent of transportation funding. Speaker \nRyan's home State of Wisconsin relies on Federal funds to cover 24 \npercent of its budget. Chairman Goodlatte's home State of Virginia \nrelies on Federal funds to cover 20 percent. All of that is at risk \nunder this amendment.\n  It would not stop there. This amendment would not only threaten our \nability to respond to economic crises, it would likely make them much \nworse. During economic downturns, Congress can help stimulate the \neconomy by cutting taxes and increasing investments, as we did during \nthe 2008 financial crisis. But if this amendment had been in place \nthen, our economy would have been in serious jeopardy, facing a much \nhigher risk of a full-on, prolonged depression and massive job losses. \nShould our country face another financial crisis, this amendment would \nbe the worst policy at the worst time.\n\n  So, in sum, this amendment would threaten the retirement security of\n\n\nevery senior who relies on Medicare or Social Security and every \nworking American paying into these programs now. It jeopardizes every \nFederal program that helps our communities grow and hardworking \nfamilies succeed. It places extreme financial strain on every State in \nthe country, and it would make it much harder for our government to \nrespond to crises or even function effectively. Other than that, it is \na great idea.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is terrible policy that ignores reality and real \nconsequences and is purely intended to save Republicans' political rear \nends.\n  It is not just me making this case. Republican Senator Bob Corker \nstated recently: ``Republicans control the House, Senate, and White \nHouse. If we were serious about balancing the budget, we would do it. \nBut instead of doing the real work, some will push this symbolic \nmeasure so they can feel good when they go home to face voters.''\n  Well said, Senator Corker.

They were here illegally in the United States during \nthose 2 years when Ms. Pelosi served as Speaker of the House and Harry \nReid was the leader of a supermajority of Democrats in the Senate and \nBarack Obama was President, yet she took no action then.\n  They could have passed a law, rather than having President Obama sign \nan illegal executive order, and given the DACA kids a pathway to \ncitizenship, but I guess it wasn't a priority then.\n  Last month, my home county, Horry County, South Carolina, settled a \nclaim brought by the United States Department of Justice. It seems the \nDepartment determined that Horry County wasn't doing enough to \naccommodate students who couldn't speak English.\n  One would think that wouldn't be much of a problem in South Carolina. \nWe are a long way from our southern border. But as it turns out, \naccording to the Horry County independent newspapers, 5,511 out of the \n44,700 students in Horry County Schools spoke English as a second \nlanguage only. That is 13 percent of the student body in Horry County, \nSouth Carolina.\n  So the school system agreed to pay a claim by paying $600,000 to \naccommodate those students who couldn't speak English. My constituents \nback home certainly have sympathy for all children--including the DACA \nchildren--but before they resolve this DACA issue, they have one \ncondition. They want the flow of illegal immigrants stopped first, and \nso do I.\n  Thirty years ago, we gave amnesty to millions of illegal aliens on \nthe promise that we would stop the flow of illegal immigration. Yet \nhere we sit again. Well, fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, \nshame on me.\n  I am willing to try to find a solution for the DACA folks, but first \nwe have to stop the flow. President Trump has made an offer to resolve \nthe DACA issue. I think it is quite reasonable. He has laid out a \ngood framework: number one, secure the border; number two, end chain \nmigration; number three, end the visa lottery.\n\n  Personally, I want to add to that list a legal obligation on \nemployers to check the immigration status of the people they hire. This \nsystem called E-Verify is already required in many States, including \nSouth Carolina. If E-Verify is required and enforced, it will end the \npractice of coming here illegally for a job.\n  In return, under the President's proposal, 1.8 million DACA \nrecipients--which is almost three times what President Obama had \nproposed--would be granted legal status, but no special pathway to \ncitizenship. They would go to the back of the line like everyone else. \nDACA recipients are illegal immigrants. Presumably, they were brought \nhere as children by their family members who, presumably, were also \nhere illegally.\n  But I would like to focus here for a few minutes on legal \nimmigration. You have to differentiate, and people confuse the two. You \nsee, our legal immigration system is quite complex, and most Americans \nare unaware of the details. But, Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out \na few things that are really important for the American public to \nunderstand about our legal immigration system.\n  We accept 1.1 million legal immigrants per year. I would like to \nrefer to this chart for a minute, which I know is hard to see on TV, \nbut as recent as the year 1970, we were accepting 200,000 legal \nimmigrants per year. That number passed 400,000 in about 1980. You can \nsee this big spike. That is when President Reagan promised us that, if \nwe would make the people who were here illegally legal, we would secure \nthis border and we wouldn't have a problem again.\n  But you see what has happened now, this is legal immigration. It has \ngone up and up and up to the point now where we are accepting almost \n1.2 million legal immigrants per year. If you add on top of that the \nhundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants coming in that number is \nmuch higher than this. This is only legal immigration.\n  Mr. Speaker, at 1.1 million legal immigrants, there are people who \nstand up here and say that we are hard-hearted if we don't accept every \nillegal immigrant who gets across our border. But the numbers say \notherwise. The numbers don't lie.\n  We are very open to immigration. We still go by the motto on the \nStatue of Liberty. We accept people from all over the world, 1.2 legal \nimmigrants a year. And look at this slide, Mr. Speaker. This is a \nrepresentation of the top 10 countries in the world that accept legal \nimmigrants.\n  You will notice on the far side, here is the United States. This is \nas of the year 2015. We accepted 1.051 million legal immigrants. The \nnext closest was Germany at 686,000. We are almost twice as much as the \nnext one. And if you add the next five together, we are still more than \nthey are.\n  So anybody who tells you that our immigration system is hard-hearted \nis simply ignoring the facts. It is baloney. We have the most open \nsystem of legal immigration in the world, by far.\n  Most countries base their immigration system on merit. Ours, on the \nother hand, two-thirds of our legal immigrants come in based on chain \nmigration. The criteria is extended family, so we end up importing a \nlot of people that have low education and low skill sets.\n  Most countries say, look, we want to use or immigration system to \nbecome\n\n\nmore competitive, to make our economy thrive, to lift not only the \nimmigrants, but the people who live here. So what they say is, if you \nhave a skill set or an educational background that we need, then you \nmove to the front of the line. It makes perfect sense. It makes sense \nfor the immigrant. It makes sense for the economy of the country. It \nmakes sense for the people who live there.\n  Ours, on the other hand, is based on chain migration. So does that \nmake us more competitive or less competitive?\n  Mr. Speaker, look at this slide. The top slide here--this is from the \nCenter on Immigration Studies--shows that immigrants, our legal \nimmigrant families, families headed by a legal immigrant in the United \nStates, 51 percent of them get some type of social safety net benefit; \n51 percent, as compared to 30 percent for the average family. The head \nof household is a native-born American. Fifty-one percent of the people \nthat we are bringing into our country under chain migration end up \nrelying on our social safety net.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have to ask you, it is only common sense. Do you think \nthat makes us more competitive or less competitive? Don't you think \nthat drives up our deficit, Mr. Speaker? Don't you think it takes \nresources away from people in this country already that need it?\n  The bottom of this slide represents the amount of dollars from our \nsocial safety net that are taken by immigrant families versus Native \nAmerican families. You can see the average immigrant family getting \nbenefits gets an average of $6,200 a year in benefits, while the \naverage family headed by somebody who was born in America gets $4,400 \nin benefits.\n  So it is very easy to see, Mr. Speaker. It is common sense that using \nchain migration in the visa lottery to determine two-thirds, 65 percent \nof our immigrants, 800,000 people, the result is that we bring in \npeople with a low education, a low skill set that end up relying on our \nsocial safety net and, in fact, make our country less competitive and \ntake resources away from folks at the bottom end of the scale here in \nAmerica that need these resources.\n\n\n  I believe our immigration system is broken. The President believes so \ntoo. He has said:\n\n       I want a bighearted deal for the DACA kids.\n\n  Leader Pelosi is also very concerned about the DACA kids obviously. \nSo we have areas of agreement, and I am glad we do. I look forward to \nan agreement that takes care of the DREAMers, secures our borders, and \nmoves us to a modern, merit-based immigration system like every other \ndeveloped country has that lifts our economy and at the same time lifts \nopportunity for all Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n"], "Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico": ["2018-05-10", "  Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this bill \nbecause I believe that it makes it more likely that a future interim \nstorage site--potentially one in New Mexico--becomes a permanent home \nfor nuclear waste.\n  I know that these are tough issues, and I agree that we have a \nresponsibility to address the waste issues that result from our country \nentering the atomic age.\n  However, addressing nuclear waste is not our only responsibility. \nSeventy years ago, rural New Mexico became ground zero for the \ndetonation of the first nuclear bomb. This marked the beginning of \nsickness and suffering for generations of people who lived and grew up \nin the Tularosa Basin.\n  ``That atomic bomb,'' Gloria wrote to me, ``has caused anguish to so \nmany people in New Mexico. . . .

Seventy years, and \nthe Federal Government has done almost nothing to recognize or \ncompensate those impacted by that test.

However, we have since learned that there \nare many more individuals who are sick or dying because they worked in \nthe uranium industry, lived near a mining operation, or lived downwind \nfrom a test. The Navajo, Hopi, and Yavapai Apache Indian Reservations \nwere particularly affected.\n\n  That is why I have repeatedly introduced the Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act Amendments to compensate those workers. We have had \nNavajo elders travel out here to Washington, D.C., and ask us in \nCongress, ``Are you waiting for us all to die to solve this problem?'' \nThe Rules Committee rejected amendments that I offered.\n  Why in the world is it that the people of New Mexico, where the first \nbomb went off, are the only ones that are left out of protections?\n  People in Nevada, Colorado, and Utah are included, but New Mexico has \nbeen left out.

I commend Chairman \nHensarling and Congressman Huizenga for their work on shepherding this \nbill through the legislative process.\n  Policymaking is complex, and Congress and Federal regulators do not \nalways get it right. We need to sometimes make changes to address new \nissues and unintended consequences that arise.\n  As we have seen for the past few years, the Dodd-Frank Act--and let \nme add that there are many of us in the real estate business and on \nbank boards who saw the effects of Dodd-Frank not allowing banks to go \ninto the communities that need them the most--contains certain \nprovisions that fit one or both of these categories and must be changed \nthrough legislative action.\n  One of these policies is the CFPB's qualified mortgage, or QM, rule. \nThe QM rule is intended to protect lenders from legal liability and \nprovide compliance certainty for mortgage loans that are low risk and \nmeet certain criteria. One of those criterion requires a mortgage \nloan's total points and fees not to be in excess of 3 percent of the \nloan's value.\n  Unfortunately, the points and fees rule often depends on who is \nmaking the loan and how title insurance is obtained, which is confusing \nfor both consumers and businesses providing these services. Also, as \nhas been mentioned, insurance premiums held in escrow are considered \npoints and fees under the QM rule, which is ridiculous. That is like \nsaying that a parent who puts money in for a 529 savings plan for his \nchildren's education is a car payment or a mortgage payment. It doesn't \nmake sense, but it discourages consumers from using this important \nfinancial management tool.\n  H.R. 1153 would address these unintended consequences and provide \nclarity for borrowers and businesses.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to \nspeak.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am actually a little bit confused. I thought this was \nsupposed to be a debate on a rule dealing with overturning onerous EPA \nregulations. Instead, our colleagues on the left want to talk about \nsomething totally nongermane and change the subject. And then we wonder \nwhy the American people get so frustrated that this institution can't \nseem to address its big issues.\n\n\n  I also heard a little bit ago an impassioned claim by my colleague on \nthe left over here that the legislation that we are talking about today \nsomehow flies in the face of the courts. That is not true because the \ncourts have already overturned this regulation one time and set it \naside, and it has cost the industries millions and millions of dollars \nthat they shouldn't have had to spend.\n  I also heard it claimed that it flies in the face of commonsense, \nscience-based evidence. That is not true because, if it were, then the \ncourts wouldn't have made the decision to set it aside in the first \nplace.\n  H.R. 1917, the BRICK Act, is about regulatory common sense, Mr. \nSpeaker, but it is also about preserving good-paying jobs in rural \ncommunities across America. Brickmakers and tile manufacturers are \nprimarily small businesses, and their product is critical for our \ninfrastructure. They have built some of the most iconic towns and \nbuildings across America, and this bill will help ensure that these \nsmall businesses are able to continue to do exactly that.\n  The EPA's current Brick MACT rule, finalized in 2015, would impose \nmillions of dollars in costs on these small businesses, all before \njudicial review of the rule is complete. And while the EPA, under the \nformer administration, estimates that the annual costs to comply with \nthe rule will be about $25 million, other estimates have projected the \nannual costs to be up to $100 million or greater.\n  For a facility with two kilns, which is the industry average, the \ncosts are estimated to be $4.4 million. Securing capital for these \nprojects will be very difficult, and some worry that it will simply not \nbe available considering that these compliance costs will not improve \nplant productivity nor help its bottom line. What is worse is that \nthese costs are over and above the tens of millions of dollars spent by \nthe industry to comply with an earlier version of the rule vacated by \nthe D.C. Circuit Court in 2007.\n  H.R. 1917 simply allows for the consideration and completion of any \njudicial review regarding the 2015 regulation before requiring \ncompliance. For an industry that has faced so much regulatory \nuncertainty, through rules, vacated rules, and now new regulation, H.R. \n1917 will help inject a bit of much-needed regulatory certainty back \ninto this industry.\n  Additionally, this bill provides regulatory relief for our wood \nheater manufacturers, which helps provide an affordable source of heat \nfor many low-income and rural households. EPA regulations set to take \neffect in 2020 are causing some manufacturers to already lay off \nworkers. This industry needs more time to comply, and a provision \nwithin H.R. 1917 will simply extend that compliance deadline from 2020 \nto 2023. If left unchanged, product choice will diminish, prices will \nrise, and more jobs will be lost.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must ensure our Federal agencies are not needlessly \nregulating companies out of business. Brick manufacturers have suffered \nheavy losses since the recession, losing about 45 percent of jobs \nbetween 2005 and 2012. Increased compliance costs from these EPA \nregulations will only lead to more job losses and consolidations within \nthis primarily family-owned business industry.\n  We owe this industry regulatory certainty. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this rule and to support H.R. 1917 because, if we don't, if the \nbrick industry gets shut down because of these onerous rules, we are \ngoing to start building buildings, Mr. Speaker, out of straw and sticks \ninstead of bricks."], "Mr. LOEBSACK": ["2018-03-06", "  Mr. LOEBSACK.

I also want to thank Mrs. Blackburn, \nchair of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee, for helping to \nmove this forward.\n  This bill, which I introduced last year, would require the FCC to \nestablish standards for collecting wireless coverage data. Everyone at \nsome point has been driving through places in rural America that don't \nget wireless coverage. Unfortunately, the maps that the FCC uses to fix \ncoverage gaps are often inadequate.\n  Currently, the standards that define how wireless coverage is \ndetermined are not sufficient, meaning the coverage maps can be \nincomplete or inaccurate.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the Kerner Report.\n  In 1968, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, known \nas the Kerner Commission, found that the civil unrest in the African \nAmerican community was a result of white racism. From employment and \nhousing discrimination to segregated and underfunded schools, racism \nwas the root cause of systemic poverty plaguing African Americans.\n  In 1969, the theme for Delta Sigma Theta under the leadership of the \nlate Frankie Muse Freeman was,``One Nation or Two?'' As we continue to \nask ourselves that same question 50 years later, it is clear that civil \nrights is still unfinished business.\n  According to 2016 Census data, 12.7 percent of Americans live in \npoverty. For African Americans, the poverty rate is nearly double the \nnational rate at 22 percent. And 33 percent of African American \nchildren are growing up in poverty.\n  The persistent racial wealth divide and lack of economic progress \namong African Americans is cause for alarm.\n  The Black unemployment rate has risen to 7.7 percent and continues to \nbe nearly double that of White workers. In 1968, it was 6.8 percent.\n  The median net worth for Black families is $17,600, compared to \n$171,000 for white families. When it comes to homeownership, 71 percent \nof White households are homeowners compared to 41 percent of Black \nhouseholds--practically the same as in 1968.\n  On the campaign trail, the President said inner cities were more \ndangerous than war zones and repeatedly asked the African American \ncommunity, ``What do you have to lose?''\n  Every day, the Trump Administration's economic policies make clear \nwhat African Americans and communities of color have to lose: economic \nopportunity and upward mobility.\n  The President's lopsided tax cut added at least $1.5 trillion to the \nnational deficit with likely offsets to earned benefits and social \nsafety net programs many families depend on like Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, and SNAP.\n  The President's budget would reduce funding for SNAP by $213 billion \nover the next 10 years and force 16 million households to survive on \nso-called ``Harvest Boxes'' that will cost more than they save in \ndollars and human capital. These proposed ``ration boxes'' are \ndemeaning to families: shelf stable milk, ready to eat cereals, canned \nmeat, fruits and vegetables, peanut butter and pasta. Is this what we \nhave come to? This is the same Republican Party who told us that we \ncouldn't provide our children healthy meals in schools.\n  While roughly 1 in 6 Black households spend more than 50 percent of \ntheir income on housing, the President's budget eliminates the National \nHousing Trust Fund and U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, the \nlegal aid program which helps families avoid unwarranted evictions, the \nCommunity Development Block Grant program, and the HOME Investment \nPartnerships Program.\n  Republicans in Congress and this Administration have chosen to rob \nthe American people of resources that could put people to work building \ninfrastructure, improve public education, child care, and health care. \nTime and again, their proposals benefit the wealthy and hurt the \nworking poor and communities of color.\n  It's no coincidence that the President wants to eliminate diversity \nvisas and prevent immigrants from Africa and Asia from coming into this \ncountry. It's no coincidence that our fellow Americans in the U.S. \nVirgin Islands and Puerto Rico are still suffering and can't get the \nresources needed to truly rebuild after Hurricane Irma and Hurricane \nMaria. Black and Brown people are not wanted. They need not apply here.\n  As we look ahead to the next fifty years, will this be one America or \ntwo? One Black and Brown, one White? One rich, one poor?\n  America will only be great if we ensure our policies create \nopportunities for all Americans and address the structural racism that \npreserves the racial wealth divide.

Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be before the House \nof Representatives this evening, and I want to thank Chairman Shimkus.\n  When I came to Congress in 2011, I didn't know many people, and one \nnight I had the privilege of meeting  John Shimkus from the great State \nof Illinois. I told him I was from Tennessee, and we started talking. \nAnd right away we talked about Yucca Mountain. We talked about nuclear \nwaste, and I told him that I was going to be representing a very \nspecial place: Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\n  So let me start by thanking Chairman  John Shimkus. He has been the \nhero for the Yucca Mountain project. He has worked tirelessly. He has \nseen this through the courts. He has seen it through the House. He has \nworked so hard. I thank him for his efforts.\n  Oak Ridge, Tennessee, it is a beautiful place. I represent the Third \nDistrict of Tennessee: Oak Ridge, where we had the Manhattan Project, \nwhere we won World War II; Oak Ridge, where we won the Cold War; Oak \nRidge, where we have worked tirelessly to build our Nation's nuclear \narsenal, and today we are still advocating to do that, to keep America \nstrong--great men and women.\n  But Oak Ridge, like many other places around the Nation--Savannah \nRiver, Portsmouth, Hanford--years ago, ladies and gentlemen, when we \nmanufactured our nuclear weapons, we were not as safe and secure as we \nare today. There was an immediacy. There was a need during World War II \nto get the bomb built, and we did it in Oak Ridge, and it ended World \nWar II.\n  But for years thereafter, we were not as safe at many of these \nvenues. What does that mean? That means that legacy wastes were left in \ncommunities: sometimes in the soil, sometimes in the water, sometimes \nin facilities. And what that means is that the Federal Government has a \nduty to these communities to clean this waste up. And this waste has to \ngo somewhere.\n  Now, Chairman Shimkus, and we have heard from Chairman Walden--for \nthose of you who are listening tonight, they are authorizers. They \nauthorize the law. I sit on the Appropriations Committee. That is the \ncommittee in Congress that authorizes the spending for this.\n  I am the chairman of the Nuclear Cleanup Caucus. That is how \npassionate I am about cleaning up nuclear waste not only in Oak Ridge, \nTennessee; Savannah River; or Hanford, but all over these great United \nStates, because we owe this to the American people.\n  The Federal Government caused this problem; the Federal Government \nneeds to clean this up. It is the ultimate, I think, in environmental \nadvocacy. This is something that Republicans and Democrats, Members of \nthe House and Members of the Senate, usually agree upon; and we have \nworked together in this very important caucus.\n  Why is it important that we pass the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments \nAct of 2017? Because, first of all, we owe it to the American people. \nThe Department of Energy does a good job in cleanup, but this will \nrevise their programs. It will give what Congress\n\n\nshould do, give direction to a Federal agency. So, as we advocate for \ndollars to clean up the nuclear waste, we need this key authorization \nbill to give it structure, to give it purpose.\n  So, in the end, Yucca is critically important--critically important. \nAnd I know the people in these affected communities want Yucca \nMountain. That is the interesting thing about it. They want it because \nthey realize it is critically important that we store the waste there: \nit is important for America; it is important for our environment; it is \nimportant to these communities; and it is long overdue.\n  So I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to please work to \nsupport H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017, and \nI thank Chairman Shimkus."], "Mr. SIRES": ["2018-01-17", "  Mr. SIRES.

Mr. Speaker, both House and Senate \nRepublicans have introduced separate plans to update the U.S. federal \ntax code. Proponents have long argued that the federal tax code is \noverdue for an overhaul that will incentivize businesses to create \njobs, while opponents feel that the existing proposals do not go far \nenough for middle- and lower-income families.\n  It has been 31 years since Congress passed its last major tax reform \noverhaul known as the 1986 Tax Reform Act, signed into law by President \nReagan. Since that time, the tax code has continued to grow more \nintricate in response to the complexities that accompany globalization \nand the unique challenges that we face in a 21st Century economy. While \nI agree that a modern tax code is desperately needed to help shore up \nfunding for critical infrastructure projects, scientific research, and \neducation, the Republican tax plan falls short of helping to address \nthese dire needs.\n  The current plan introduced in the House will expose an estimated 38 \nmillion middle class households to increased taxes, while \nsimultaneously reducing the tax liability for some of our wealthiest \ncorporations. The bill proposes disastrous cuts to Medicare & Medicaid, \nwhich many seniors and underprivileged Americans rely on for medical \ncare. The plan also eliminates many tax deductions that are favorable \nto middle class Americans, such as the medical expense deduction, \nstudent loan interest deductions, and the state and local Tax \ndeduction. Despite all of these reductions, the House Republican plan \nwill cost the American people $1.7 trillion dollars over the next 10 \nyears in order to pay for tax cuts for corporations and wealthy \nAmericans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe that many of my colleagues will agree that we \nare due for a major reform of our tax code. However, we must be \nextremely careful not to do so at the expense of millions of middle and \nlower class Americans who are already struggling to get by. An \nincreasingly globalized economy means that we will need to delicately \nbalance our national interests against our ability to compete overseas. \nHowever, the current tax reform plans in the House and Senate must do \nmore to protect American workers, their families, and the critical \nsocial programs on which they depend.\n"], "Mr. BISHOP of Utah": ["2018-04-25", "  Mr. BISHOP of Utah.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of \nInvestigator Maggi Holbrook with the Vancouver Police Department, and \nrecognize her contributions to Southwest Washington during 16 years of \npublic service.\n  Investigator Holbrook's dedication to the community can be seen \nthrough her long service to the Vancouver, Washington, Seattle, \nWashington, and Portland, Oregon areas. In the Vancouver Police \nDepartment, she established a Digital Evidence Cybercrimes Unit that \nhas worked on or assisted all levels of crimes. In addition, \nInvestigator Holbrook was an invaluable resource for the Washington \nState Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force and the \nSeattle Police Department. Her efforts of the task force to \ninvestigate, prosecute and convict those individuals who would harm \nvulnerable children are admirable.\n  As one of the first investigators in Washington certified in Peer to \nPeer child pornography investigations, Investigator Holbrook brought \nher proactive approach to child sexual exploitation investigations. She \nquickly became proficient in the very technical and labor intensive \nmethods for identifying Internet Protocol addresses of offenders \noffering to share child pornography files across the Internet. Through \nthese cases, she identified one child sexual-abuser after another and \nused the expertise and credibility she'd developed to convict them in \ncourt. Investigator Holbrook is considered a leading expert in these \ntypes of investigations, has certified hundreds of other investigators \nin the use of Peer to Peer investigative technology and assisted many \nmore with investigations.\n  Due to Investigator Holbrook's hard work and collaborative nature, \nshe paved the way for the Vancouver Police Department to become an \nAffiliate Agency for the Department of Justice's Internet Crimes \nAgainst Children Task Force in Washington State. Through this task \nforce, Investigator Holbrook has made hundreds of referrals to agencies \nstatewide and internationally that have resulted in the arrest and \nconviction of numerous Child Sexual Exploitation offenders.\n  For example, Investigator Holbrook was called to conduct the \nforensics on a particularly difficult child pornography case where \nproving possession was critical to obtain a successful prosecution. \nInvestigator Holbrook initially identified a Peer to Peer user sharing \nchild pornography and forwarded this information to Cowlitz County \nauthorities for investigation. The resulting search warrant led to the \nidentification and seizure of 13 child pornography files on the \ndefendant's computer. Further investigation, however, revealed the \ndefendant had successfully deleted hundreds of files that he had been \nsharing over the course of eighteen months. Holbrook assisted the \nAssistant U.S. Attorney Grady Leupold and the team who successfully \nlitigated the perpetrator. Investigator Holbrook's selfless dedication \nto an investigation far beyond her case responsibility played a pivotal \nrole in bringing this person to justice.\n  Over the years, Investigator Holbrook has been a tremendous and \nvaluable partner to law enforcement agencies across the state as well \nas many federal partners: Department of Homeland Security Child \nExploitation Unit, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. \nMarshals Service, the United States Postal Service and the U.S. Secret \nService.\n  Holbrook has had an outstanding career that has been dedicated in not \nonly the successful criminal investigations and rescues of children, \nbut in building resources to assist others in their efforts. Her work \nhave contributed to training the next generation of investigators, \nforensic examiners and even prosecutors to carry on this extremely \nnecessary and valuable work.\n  Southwest Washington is proud to have had such an extremely talented \nand dedicated individual as Investigator Holbrook. Her contributions \nand accomplishments in support of the Washington State ICAC Task Force \nmission will positively impact Southwest Washington for generations to \ncome. I want to thank Investigator Holbrook for her tireless work and \ncongratulate her on her retirement.\n"], "The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Moolenaar)": ["2017-11-07", "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Moolenaar).

Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague from New \nMexico, Senator Heinrich, to discuss the Securing America's Voting \nEquipment Act of 2017, or the SAVE Act, which we introduced earlier \nthis week.\n  I know that you are well aware that the Senate Intelligence Committee \nhas been conducting an in-depth investigation into attempts by the \nRussians to interfere with our elections last fall. What we have found \nis that the Russians' active measures preceded last fall, and they \ncontinue to this very day.\n  We have an election coming up in November of this year and a major \nelection next year, and both Senator Heinrich and I believe that it is \nso important that we act to assist States in protecting the integrity \nof their voting systems.\n  Our bill seeks to facilitate information sharing on the threats posed \nto State election systems by foreign adversaries, to provide guidance \nto States on how to protect their systems against nefarious activity, \nand, for States that choose to do so, to allow them to access some \nFederal grant money to implement best practices to protect their \nsystems.\n  Let me be clear that I know of no evidence to date that actual vote \ntabulations were manipulated in any State in the elections last fall. \nNevertheless, as early as the summer of 2016, the FBI discovered that \nforeign-based hackers had gained access to voter registration databases \nin two States. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that \nRussia-linked actors attempted to access voter rolls and registration \ndata in those two States.\n  More alarming is that further investigation revealed that many more \nStates than just two were ultimately found to have had their voting \nsystems probed by the Russians. The Department of Homeland Security \nnotified election officials in a total of 21 States that their election \nsystems had been targeted by Russian Government-linked hackers.\n  If voter rolls were altered or voting equipment tampered with, a \ncompromise of these systems could open the door to voter \ndisenfranchisement and would undermine public confidence and the \nintegrity of our free and fair elections--a bedrock principle of our \ndemocracy.\n  In response to these alarming threats, the SAVE Act would assist \nStates in hardening their systems. It does not aim to tell States how \nto conduct their elections. The responsibility for conducting elections \nwould remain with each State, as has been our country's tradition since \nits founding. State and local election officials alone, however, cannot \nbe expected to defend against cyber attacks from foreign adversaries. \nThat is why our bill seeks to bring to bear the unique authorities, \ncapabilities, and resources that the Federal Government can offer to \nState and local election officials.\n  Let me briefly describe the Heinrich-Collins bill.\n  First, our bill would codify a decision made by both Secretaries of \nHomeland Security, Jeh Johnson and John Kelly, to designate election \nsystems as ``critical infrastructure.'' This designation allows DHS to \nprioritize providing assistance to election jurisdictions and to \nestablish formal mechanisms to enhance information sharing and \ncollaboration within the electoral sector. More than 30 States took \nadvantage of DHS's offer of assistance last year.\n  Our bill also addresses a shortcoming that I raised during a hearing \nbefore the Senate Intelligence Committee in June regarding foreign \nefforts to compromise American voting systems. During this hearing, we \nlearned that not a single secretary of state had been cleared to \nreceive classified information before the 2016 election or in the 6 \nmonths since voting systems had been declared as critical \ninfrastructure. This delay is truly inexplicable. We have to be able to \nshare this critical information in order for State election officials \nto take the necessary steps to safeguard their systems.\n  Our bill addresses this limitation on information sharing by \nauthorizing the Director of National Intelligence to provide security \nclearances to designated chief election officials in each State. That \nway, the intelligence community can share appropriate classified \ninformation with States regarding foreign threats targeting election \nsystems.\n  Our bill also mandates that DHS conduct a threat assessment on \nphysical and electronic risks to voting systems. Then, in collaboration \nwith stakeholders, the Department will develop best practices to \naddress those risks.\n  A few simple measures can make a big difference. Best practices like \nrelying upon paper ballots, as the State of Maine currently does, and \nconducting postelection audits to ensure that the tabulation by vote-\ncounting machines matches the results of the paper ballots can bolster \nboth resilience and public confidence in the integrity of the voting \nprocess.\n  Finally, our bill creates a Federal grant program available for \nStates to upgrade and safeguard the integrity of their systems by \nimplementing the best practices that have been identified.\n  Last year, the Russian Government sought to disrupt our democracy by \nthreatening the integrity of our elections. It is incumbent upon \nCongress to\n\n\nassist the States and those charged with conducting elections at the \nlocal, State, and Federal level to protect them from foreign \ninterference. Our bill would do just that.\n  I am very pleased to work with the leader on this effort, Senator \nHeinrich, and I would urge all of our colleagues to join Senator \nHeinrich and me in sponsoring this bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President."], "The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Kustoff of Tennessee)": ["2018-03-06", "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Kustoff of Tennessee).

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition of the Working Families \nFlexibility Act, H.R. 1180.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) already allows \nemployers to let their employees earn paid time off.\n  That is why the bill passed by the House earlier this week, the \nWorking Families Flexibility Act, H.R. 1180, would hurt working \nfamilies by giving workers less time off, less flexibility and less \npay.\n  Many workers frequently rely on their overtime earnings to make ends \nmeet to help put food on the table, keep a roof over their families' \nheads, and pay bills.\n  Instead of paying workers for their overtime work, H.R. 1180 would \npermit employers to replace employees' overtime pay with vague promises \nthat employees may be able to take comp time off at some unknown point \nin the future.\n  But the employer, not the employee, would decide when that time off \nis granted.\n  This bill provides no guarantees that workers could take their earned \ntime off when they need it.\n  Employers could also unilaterally decide to ``cash out'' comp time in \nexcess of 80 hours or discontinue their entire comp time program with \njust 30 days' notice.\n  This means that an employee's carefully crafted plan to bank time for \na child's birth or a spouse's surgery could be thwarted by an \nemployer's decision to cash out the employee's time or end the program \nall together.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is a bad deal for working families. It would \nstrip employees of rights that the FLSA has provided for nearly 75 \nyears.\n  If Republicans truly care about working families, they would support \nand help pass the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act (FAMILY Act), \nH.R. 947, which would create a national paid leave insurance program \nmodeled after the successful programs in California, New Jersey, and \nRhode Island.\n  If Republicans truly care about working families, they would support \nand help pass legislation like Schedules That Work Act introduced by \nCongresswoman Rosa DeLauro in the 114th Congress.\n  The Schedules That Work Act would give workers more control over \ntheir schedules and incentivize predictability and stability in shifts \nand work hours.\n  If Republicans truly care about working families, they would support \nand help pass the soon to be introduced Raise the Wage Act sponsored by \nCongressman Bobby Scott.\n  The Raise the Wage Act increases minimum wage, including the \nelimination of sub-minimum ``tipped'' wage, which would lift 37.7 \nmillions workers out of poverty.\n  People should not have to work more than 40 hours in a week and forgo \npay to earn time to care for themselves or their loved ones.\n  I join my Democratic colleagues in fighting to protect attacks on pay \nand benefits for working class families instead, and will vote no on \nH.R. 1180.\n"], "Ms. BLACK": ["2017-02-16", "  Ms. BLACK.

From his education at the University of Maryland School of \nAgriculture to his first job in the poultry industry to his career at \nfinancial cooperative Farm Credit, he has worked tirelessly on behalf \nof farmers and their rural communities.\n   Mr. Farmer's lasting legacy and greatest impact has been his work at \nColonial Farm Credit. He began his career as a loan officer in \nFarmville, Virginia working with poultry, tobacco, dairy, and cattle \nfarmers during agriculture's difficult times in the 1980s. His efforts \nkept a lot of farmers in the field and working. These early experiences \nshaped his determination that the best way for Farm Credit to serve the \ncommunity was to maintain strong credit standards in order to have the \nability to be a steady resource for farmers in both good and bad times.\n   As Chief Credit Officer, he laid the groundwork to mold Colonial \nFarm Credit into the cooperative it is today. Respected and admired for \nhis ability to understand credit policy and apply it correctly, he set \nthe standard by which loan officers make and underwrite loans today.\n   This straightforward approach served him well when he was chosen by \nthe board of directors to be President and CEO in 2000. Since that \ntime, the cooperative has grown in loan volume, become a standard in \nthe industry for its excellent performance, and has become the lender \nof choice for farmers and foresters in eastern Virginia and southern \nMaryland.\n   In addition to leading a $665 million lending institution employing \n76 people, Greg has also found time to be an integral part of the \ncommunity. He serves on both the board of Agriculture in the Classroom \nand as a consultant to the Colonial Agricultural Educational \nFoundation. He is a participant in many agricultural events and has \nbeen an active voice on Capitol Hill meeting Members of Congress as an \nadvocate for the interests of the rural and agricultural communities.\n   Mr. Farmer is widely known as a man of great integrity, \nintelligence, and common sense and can be relied on to analyze problems \nand give a reasoned and researched response. He is also a great \nrepresentative not only for Farm Credit, but for cooperatives and \nagriculture in general.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of an amazing Idaho \nfamily which has taken a horrible personal tragedy and turned it into a \ncause that will benefit many other families in the years to come. I am \nreferring to the family of Shauna Hill, a 16-year-old girl who lived in \nEagle, Idaho, in my district, and who tragically lost her life in 2012.\n  At the time of her untimely death, Shauna was a junior at Eagle High \nSchool. She was a competitive figure skater and ice dancer and played \nthe violin in her school orchestra. She even performed with the \norchestra at New York's Carnegie Hall.\n  She was also working to qualify for a Congressional Silver Medal for \npublic service, personal development, and physical fitness. She aspired \nto attend Stanford University and become a doctor. Sadly, she lost her \nlife in a car accident on her way home from orchestra practice.\n  I first met Shauna's parents, Captain Edward Hill and his wife, \nHeidi, in 2013, when I helped present them with the Congressional \nBronze Medal their daughter had earned. While presenting the award, I \nlearned that Captain Hill, who served 28 years as a Navy pilot and flew \nto protect America during three combat tours, had retired shortly \nbefore Shauna's death.\n  Following the tragedy, Captain Hill was working with the Navy to try \nto reassign his benefits to his second child, Haley, who was also \nplanning to attend college. With almost 3 decades of distinguished \nservice, Captain Hill qualified for the full utilization of the \neducation benefit, but the Navy said Haley wasn't eligible because \neducation benefits under the GI bill cannot be reassigned.\n  The Hills asked for my help, and my staff got to work. Unfortunately, \nwe found out that the Navy's hands were tied. Current law does not \nallow the transfer of education benefits after a servicemember has \nretired. No waivers are permitted, even in such tragic circumstances.\n  I promised the Hills that I would seek a legislative solution. In \nFebruary of this year, I introduced H.R. 1112, the Shauna Hill Post 9/\n11 Education Benefits Transferability Act. This bill would permit the \nreassignment of veterans' education benefits in cases where the \ndesignated beneficiary passes away.\n  Losing a child is the worst thing I can imagine, and surely Congress \ndidn't intend to exclude the ability to transfer benefits to a \nsurviving child or spouse.\n  The bill I introduced would correct this oversight, and it has \nreceived support from many veterans' groups. These include: the \nConcerned Veterans for America, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, \nthe Student Veterans of America, AMVETS, the Air Force Sergeants \nAssociation, the Association of the United States Navy, and the \nNational Military Family Association.\n  This month, VA Committee Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz \nincluded my bill in the bipartisan GI Bill, the Harry W. Colmery \nVeterans Education Assistance Act of 2017. This bill passed the House \nlast night, and I was proud to join my colleagues in voting for it.\n  I am grateful to Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for including \nmy bill in their legislation. I am also thankful to Senator Crapo, who \nhas introduced companion legislation in the Senate. Now that the House \nhas acted, it is my hope that the Senate will act too and, from there, \nour bill can be signed into law.\n  This legislation will mean a great deal to the Hills. It will be a \ngreat comfort to them and all those who have experienced such a \nterrible loss. As a grateful nation, it is the least that we can do, \nand America must always be a grateful nation.\n  The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Education Assistance Act of 2017 keeps \nour promises to our veterans and their families, especially when they \nneed it the most.\n\n\n"], "The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Williams)": ["2017-11-01", "  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Williams).

Mr. President, I rise to again highlight the importance \nof enacting tax reform. I listened to the Democratic leader's speech. I \nhave heard that speech a thousand times--a thousand times how only \nwealthy Americans are going to benefit from anything the Republicans \ncan come up with. Well, do you know what? Americans are smarter than \nthat. Americans are smarter than that.\n  I represent a State, West Virginians who have struggling economic \nsituations. If I were to go out on the street in West Virginia, and as \nI talked to individuals there, and asked them: Would you like more of \nyour hard-earned money at the end of the day and have a tax cut and tax \nrelief, I can guarantee you 100 percent would say: Heck, yeah. I can \nspend my money better at home with my priorities than what you are \ndoing in Washington, DC. So let's not let that argument rule the day. \nAs I said, we are smarter than that.\n  Let's talk about what this bill does. This is now my fourth, \nactually, in a series of something I believe in, which is tax reform \nfor everybody in this country.\n  My first speech described the benefits we will have in economic \ngrowth. Something that was not mentioned by the previous speaker is how \nwe have been stagnated for so long. The economic growth will rise all \nboats. Every middle-class worker will benefit from this, and every \nsmall business will benefit from this. My second speech was about small \nbusinesses. Ninety-five percent of my State is small business. Last \nweek, I highlighted the importance of passing the budget resolution to \nallow Congress to move forward, and we did that.\n  Today, I want to talk about the importance of tax reform for middle-\nclass families and the impacts this bill will have on them, the very \nreal impact. You know what, raising a family is very expensive today. A \nrecent study from the Department of Agriculture found that middle-\nincome households will spend over $230,000 raising a child. It is \nstaggering--staggering.\n\n  The Federal Reserve found that almost half of American families are \nstruggling right now to come up with $400 if they have an emergency \nexpense. In West Virginia, where the median income is $41,000--hardly \nthe wealthy--families are forced to make hard tradeoffs as they balance \ntheir checkbooks each month.\n  Expenses are going up. Yet most Americans haven't received a raise in \nyears. So we need to help working families, especially those living \npaycheck to paycheck, and this is one of the primary goals of our tax \nreform. We want middle-class, middle-earned-income\n\n\nfolks, hard-working folks to get more in their pocket to decide what \nthey want to do with their money. I raised three children. I know just \nputting shoes on your children is an expensive proposition. Maybe you \nwant to plan for a trip or save for college. Well, to pay for childcare \nand to save for college at the same time is almost impossible for our \nyoung families today.\n  The framework we have set forward, I think, will help our families in \nmany ways. First, it calls for a significant increase in the child tax \ncredit. Yesterday, a number of my colleagues from the House and the \nSenate, joined with Ivanka Trump to highlight what an improved child \ntax credit would mean for working families. The tax reform proposal \nwould allow families to take a higher per child credit, saving money on \ntheir taxes--money they have earned, money the families deserve to \nspend on their own, and money that could have significant impact to our \nfamilies.\n  We will also create a $500 tax credit for families who are caring for \na nonchild dependent. Many Americans find themselves in the sandwich \ngeneration, where they are not only caring for their children, they are \ncaring for their parents at the same time. This will help those \nfamilies.\n  Second, the proposal nearly doubles the standard deduction or the \nzero tax bracket. It raises it up to $24,000 for married taxpayers and \nup to $12,000 for single taxpayers.\n  What kind of impact would this have on a State like mine? Well, 83 \npercent of the taxpayers in West Virginia take the standard deduction. \nThey are going to get a doubling in their standard deduction. That is \nmore money for them to take home, to put the value of where they want \nto spend it with their own families. So four out of five West Virginia \nworking families will benefit from that. That is an enormous savings, \nand even more taxpayers are likely to benefit, as the larger standard \ndeduction means fewer people will itemize. We expect that figure to go \nup--from 83 percent up. It makes filing taxes simpler, and it makes it \nso our taxpayers can file on a single form without all of the extra \nforms, time, and money it takes.\n  Finally, and most importantly, families will benefit from the \neconomic growth that tax reform will bring to our country. This is \nprobably the biggest impact that tax reform will have for working \nfamilies. We will lower the corporate rate, yes, for companies, but we \nhave to make our companies competitive across the globe. We are not. We \nare not competing. What kind of effect does that have? Fewer jobs and \nlower wages. Companies know that if they invest in their workforce, if \nthey invest in the wages of their workforce, they are going to have a \nmore productive workforce to produce products, to sell products, to \nenhance the quality of life of their communities.\n  Many of these large corporations that are scattered around our \ncountry really do a lot of work in the community service parts of our \ncountry, whether it is helping with schools or whether it is helping \nwith the baseball teams or sponsoring a robotics team. Why does that \nmatter to working families? More than $2 trillion in profits earned by \nAmerican companies is kept offshore because of the flaws in our current \ntax system--$2 trillion--and I think some of those estimates might be \nlow. Shifting to a more fair and competitive system will bring those \ndollars back to the United States. Those companies want to invest in \nour country because they know we have the safest investments, we have \nthe most technologically advanced and we have the best workforce, and \nthis is great news for American families.\n  The White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates that lowering \nthat tax rate--that corporate tax rate--from 35 to 20 could increase \nthe pay for the average American by about $4,000. At my small business \nroundtable, when I asked, what would you do with tax relief, the first \nthing she said was ``raise the wages of my seven employees.''\n  So I think that this would be good news for working families, \ncertainly good news for 50 percent of the West Virginia workers who \nwork in small business. We need to make sure we work together, that we \ntarget our tax relief to middle-class families.\n  I say to the Acting President pro tempore, you and I were at lunch \nthe other day with the President. Priority No. 1, the President said \nthat this tax cut must be targeted to the middle class, the working \nfamilies in this country. That is what this bill has put forward: \nlarger tax credit, larger standard deduction, unlocking the wages by \nlowering the competitive tax rate. Despite our hard work, too many \nmiddle-class families are falling behind, and we want to make sure that \ntrend stops.\n  So all of us, I think, can join together. This is going to go through \ncommittee. Both parties will have lots of opportunity to weigh in, and \nI look forward to looking into the eyes of the working men and women in \nmy State and saying: Not only is help on the way, but help is here.\n  Thank you so much.\n  I yield the floor."], "Mr. JOYCE of Ohio": ["2018-02-23", "  Mr. JOYCE of Ohio.

Our caseworkers and team have had the privilege of helping over \n11,000 constituents with federal agencies. Throughout the years, as \njust one part of our outreach efforts, we've made contact with over a \nmillion constituents via telephone town halls.\n  To all the hardworking, decent citizens of Georgia's 6th District who \nhave given me the privilege of representing them in Congress--I will be \nforever grateful.\n  Mr. Speaker, as you know, constituents are the reason that we're \ngiven this honor to serve and I know that my Georgia colleagues \nunderstand and appreciate this immense responsibility.\n  Over the years, my Georgia colleagues in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and Georgia's Senators, including Senators Isakson, \nPerdue, and Chambliss, and I have worked together to secure wins for \nour great state.\n  We've worked in a bipartisan fashion to help advance the necessary \nexpansion of the Savannah Harbor, key to promoting our state's commerce \nand a critical component to helping grow our economy and create jobs.\n  We've also worked together to preserve and safeguard Georgia and the \nAtlanta area's access to a reliable water source, so that our local \ncommunities and state can continue to grow and prosper.\n  More recently, we succeeded in enacting a law to rename a Marietta \nPost Office in honor of a true hero, Marietta's Marine Lance Corporal \nSkip Wells, a proud Marine who made the ultimate sacrifice and \nselflessly gave his life to protect his fellow servicemembers and to \nprotect our nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have served and to have experienced \nfirsthand our representative democracy in action, and alongside such \nhonorable, dedicated public servants who have offered me both their \nfriendship and counsel during my time in Congress.\n  Over the past twelve years, I have had the honor to be chosen by my \ncolleagues to serve as Chairman of the Republican Study Committee in \nthe 111th Congress and in the 112th Congress as a member of the House \nRepublican Leadership as Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. \nIn these leadership roles, my House colleagues and I have helped \nadvance conservative Republican principles and solutions aimed at \ntackling the challenges facing America.\n  Additionally, during the 114th Congress, it was an honor to be chosen \nto serve as the Chairman of the House Budget Committee where we \nsucceeded in passing the first joint ten-year balanced budget agreement \nin over a decade. That success was due in large part to the tremendous \nstaff on the committee as well as my colleagues who served on this \ncommittee in both the House and Senate.\n  Together, we have much to be proud of, especially the work done to \nadvance a real reform of the Congressional Budget Process. We must fix \nour broken budget process in order to enhance constitutional authority, \nstrengthen budget enforcement, reverse the higher spending bias in \nCongress, control automatic spending, increase transparency, and ensure \nfiscal sustainability.\n  Our budget resolutions have provided blueprints for how we can put \nour nation's fiscal house in order while saving and strengthening vital \nhealth and retirement programs as well as ensuring needed resources for \nthose who protect and defend our great nation; solutions that will \nensure taxpayer dollars from American families and businesses are spent \nin an accountable and effective way.\n  It is through the budget process that Congress has begun an important \neffort to put in place positive, patient-centered solutions to fix our \nnation's broken health care system. The status quo is harming Americans \nand their families.\n  Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues know, helping achieve access to \nquality, affordable health care for all Americans has long been a \ndriving force behind my legislative efforts in Congress. My first \nprofessional calling was to care for patients, following in the \nfootsteps of both my father and grandfather who were also physicians.\n  That's why we authored and introduced the Empowering Patients First \nAct, an alternative to Obamacare with real, patient-centered reforms to \nbuild a more innovative and responsive health care system--one that \nempowers patients and ensures they and their doctor have the freedom to \nmake health care decisions without bureaucratic interference or \ninfluence.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my goal and commitment to the American people that \nI will work as Secretary of HHS to ensure that our health care system \nadheres to what I call the six principles of health care: \naffordability, accessibility, quality, choices, innovation, and \nresponsiveness.\n  The new administration and HHS will work together with the Congress \nto get Washington out of the way, to protect and strengthen our \ncountry's health care system to help improve the lives of the American \npeople, to help heal individuals and whole communities across our \nbeloved nation.\n  It is truly an honor to accept President Trump's nomination to serve \nour nation as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices. My obligation will be to carry to the Department both an \nappreciation for bipartisan, team-driven policymaking and what has been \na lifetime commitment to improving the health and well-being of the \nAmerican people.\n  I am humbled by the incredible challenges that lay ahead and \nenthusiastic for the opportunity to be a part of solving them on behalf \nof all Americans. There is much work to be done to ensure we have a \nhealth care system that works for patients, families, and doctors; that \nleads the world in the cure and prevention of illness; and that is \nbased on sensible rules to protect the well-being of the country while \nembracing its innovative spirit.\n  With a healthy dose of humility and appreciation for the scope of the \nchallenges before us, with the assistance of my fellow Americans and \nwith God's will, we can make it happen.\n  Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today \nand once again, thank you to the constellation of individuals who have \ngiven me this great honor to serve as the Congressman for Georgia's 6th \nDistrict. May God continue to bless you and our beloved United States \nof America.\n"], "The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman)": ["2018-01-21", "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman).

Mr. President, I am here to share the words, the \nstories, the fears, and some of the faces of people in Connecticut who \nwill be impacted by the bill that was released this morning--the so-\ncalled discussion draft, if that is the right term for it. We learned \nthis morning, I think, why that discussion draft has been shrouded in \nsecrecy. The reason is very simply that my Republican colleagues are \nashamed and embarrassed about it, and rightly, because it is not only \nmean, as the House bill was, but it is meaner. It is cruel and costly.\n  It will be cruel and costly to the people of Connecticut, in human \nsuffering and illness and disease, and it will be costly in failing to \nprevent and treat disease before it becomes more expensive. That is one \nof the lessons of public health policy today: Treat earlier; prevent \nbefore diseases or illnesses or conditions become even more costly. It \nis not only a way to save lives; it is a way to save money.\n  The voices and faces of Connecticut have been heard nowhere in this \nprocess because of its secrecy, because it has denied anyone in \nAmerica, in fact, the opportunity to be heard, to comment, to make \ntheir views known. Speed and secrecy have been the watchwords, and they \nare a toxic recipe, and they should mean this discussion draft is dead \non delivery today.\n  My constituents have actually come in overwhelming numbers to an \nemergency field hearing on healthcare that I began in Hartford earlier \nthis week, Monday morning at 9 a.m. They came for 2 hours. There were \nmany more than we expected on very short notice, and they were there to \nmake sure their voices and faces were heard and seen. That is what I \ndid earlier in the week when I entered their testimony into the Record \nof the Senate. I was proud to do so.\n  We are continuing that emergency field hearing, in fact, tomorrow at \n1:30 in New Haven at the Aldermanic Chambers, which have even greater \ncapacity. We are expecting many more, judging by the response to the \nemail blast and invitations that we have sent, because people care \nabout healthcare.\n  They should care because it is the difference between life and death, \nand this bill will be the difference between life and death for so many \npeople in Connecticut. It will be death. Even though that statement may \nsound like hyperbole or exaggeration, the public health experts, the \ndocs, and the hospitals that deliver healthcare in Connecticut and \naround the country know that it is true, and so do the people of \nConnecticut and our country.\n\n\n  My colleagues have failed to hear those faces and voices because they \nhave refused to have hearings, markups, committee meetings, and robust \nfull debate on the floor of this Chamber, as is the practice and should \nbe in other pieces of legislation. Why is it not for one of historic \nand unprecedented importance for the future of our Nation?\n  Instead, they have met behind closed doors, a group of men who, \nmaybe, coincidently, produced a bill that defunds Planned Parenthood \nand, in effect, furthers a war on women's health--an assault on women's \nhealthcare that will deny mammograms, screenings, preventive care--and \non primary care for men, as well as women, in this country.\n  It will gut Medicare and Medicaid. It will rob millions of people of \nthe healthcare they now have through Medicaid. It will mean higher \ncosts and less care for America and especially for our seniors, who \nwill be among the most victimized by these cuts.\n  For anyone who cares about opioid addiction and abuse--and everyone \nin this Chamber, by an overwhelming majority, during the last session \nvoted for the 21st Century Cures Act and then for the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act, bipartisan, but it was nowhere nearly \nenough funded--this bill means, in fact, less funding than the House \nmeasure would have provided, from $65 billion increased funding for \nopioid addiction and abuse treatment to $2 billion.\n  When my colleagues characterize this bill as heartless, they \nunderestimate its impact on people who suffer from the disease--it is a \ndisease, not a moral failing--of addiction and abuse.\n  Yesterday the voices and faces that I elicited on the floor of the \nSenate were three people who have struggled with substance use disorder \nand encountered different endings--Justice, Sean, and Frank. We lost \nSean just a few weeks ago. Frank could not come to the hearing we \nconducted on Monday because he is recovering, as well, and the \nheartbreak of Sean's loss so affected him.\n  But Maria Skinner described their struggle to recover from that \nsubstance use disorder. Justice will likely never recover from the \ninjuries she sustained when she overdosed. Although Frank is doing \nwell, I am pleased to say he has access to Medicaid and the essential \ntreatment services that he needs only because Medicaid exists in the \npresent form. Denying him that kind of service and treatment means that \nhe may be consigned to the risk that doomed Justice and Sean. The \ncoldheartedness of the House bill was hard to match, but on Medicaid \nthe Senate version has outdone even that coldheartedness--cutting the \nprogram even more drastically and costing our Nation, not just \nhealthcare but also jobs.\n  When we say Medicaid, let's be very clear whom we are talking about, \nand let me introduce three of the people who are affected.\n  With me in this photograph are Evan, Amelie, and Amanda. They live \nwith their mom in Ansonia, CT. Following their father's death 6 years \nago, the entire family went on Medicaid so they could continue \nreceiving the coverage they need and deserve and the healthcare they \nneed and deserve.\n  Their mom reached out to my office to speak at the hearing that I am \nhaving tomorrow. She wrote to me:\n\n       I am very frightened that federal funding for state \n     Medicaid programs will receive tremendous cuts with this \n     potential repeal. I hope to advocate to all those in \n     positions of power that will listen so they can see a face to \n     this problem.\n\n  The face to this problem is before us in this Chamber. It is children \nand families that will see Medicaid decimated for them if the \nAffordable Care Act is repealed, as would be done by this so-called \ndiscussion draft from our Republican colleagues.\n  Today Evan, Amelie, and Amanda's mom is just learning how tremendous \nthese cuts will be, and today she will fear even more for her \nchildren's health and well-being, because when we talk about cuts to \nMedicaid, we aren't talking about a line item on a budget. We aren't \ntalking about a simple number or a statistic. We are talking about \nliterally millions of children like Evan, Amelie, and Amanda, who have \nparents fearing what will happen if their reliance on Medicaid is \nbetrayed ruthlessly, senselessly, and recklessly and if their \ndependence on this vital program for the basic healthcare they need is \nstripped away.\n  This bill would also jeopardize affordable access to people with \npreexisting conditions. At my hearing, a woman named Michelle Virshup \ntold her story of how the Affordable Care Act was there for her to \nprovide coverage as well as services when she was diagnosed with an \nautoimmune disease in her early twenties. Now, 3 years later, she is \ndoing a lot better and is actually an attorney fighting to remove \nbarriers to healthcare for others in her community. She will suffer \nunder this bill because her access to essential services will be \nweakened. She will be stripped of coverage that is actually affordable. \nShe will be effectively cut from healthcare once and for all.\n  When telling me about her illness, Michelle said:\n\n       The Affordable Care Act allowed me to see it through and \n     the Affordable Care Act protects me now. Though my health is \n     good, my experience is a preexisting condition that will \n     follow me for the rest of my life.\n\n  That is the thing about a preexisting condition. It follows people \nfor the rest of their lives. It is preexisting before they have \ninsurance coverage, and so it is preexisting forever. This bill, in \nenabling States to eviscerate the safeguards against abuse of \npreexisting conditions, means their healthcare will be in jeopardy and \ntheir lives will be at risk and the abuses that I fought when I was \nattorney general--time after time, year after year--will come back \nagain.\n  Among the most meaningful of the work I did as attorney general was \nto fight person by person when insurance companies said: No, we will \nnot cover that preexisting condition. Their excuse proved to be a ruse, \na charade, because they could abuse preexisting conditions, and they \nwill do it again if this bill passes.\n  This bill's depravity unfortunately goes even further. It actually \ndefunds Planned Parenthood, our Nation's largest women's healthcare \nprovider, while eviscerating protections that guarantee women have \naccess to maternal care throughout their pregnancy. It not only stops \nand undermines effective family planning, but it then denies effective \nhealthcare when women become pregnant. So it is a kind of catch-22.\n  This action is cruelly ironic, turning women away from basic birth \ncontrol services and then threatening their access to maternity care \nwhen they unavoidably become pregnant. It is really and simply \ndevastatingly bad public policy, a foolish proposal that attacks \nwomen's healthcare and defunds Planned Parenthood, which is an \noverwhelmingly popular healthcare provider. The objective is to score \ncheap political points on the far right.\n\n  Tomorrow in Connecticut, when I hold another hearing--and we may have \nanother afterward--many of my colleagues may wonder why. They may well \nbe scared of having that kind of hearing, where they have to listen to \nthe voices and see the faces of the people who will suffer under this \nbill. They certainly have been too scared to have that kind of hearing \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  I will hear from the people this bill will hurt. I will hear from \npeople whose lives will be put at risk as a result of this heartless, \ncruel, and costly measure. I will be inspired by these people, and I \nwill fight as long and as hard as possible to be sure that this bill \nnever becomes law.\n  Listening to our constituents is really the way democracy is supposed \nto work. We are proud of talking about democracy. We are approaching \nthe Fourth of July. What better way to celebrate our democracy than to \nlisten in this Chamber, in these halls, to the people who have \nexpertise and experience that we need instead of the secrecy and speed \nthat we are seeing now.\n  I am proud that we are having these hearings in Connecticut. I urge \nmy colleagues to do the same. They are emergency hearings because we \nface the historic and unprecedented exigencies of a proposed bill that \nwill rip away guarantees of effective insurance coverage that Americans \nneed and deserve.\n  Healthcare is a right. Eventually we will have single-payer in this \ncountry. But for now, let's build on the Affordable Care Act, let's \nmake it better, let's cure its defects, and let's work together across \nthe aisle. We can do that if we have that resolve.\n\n\n  Thank you. I yield the floor."], "Mrs. FISHER": ["2017-08-02", "  Mrs. FISHER.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \ncall attention to Wawa, Inc., a Pennsylvania based company that will be \nopening up their very first store in our nation's capital tomorrow. The \ncitizens of Pennsylvania are well acquainted with Wawa food stores; \nit's where many of them go for their morning coffee as well as a common \ndestination for fresh food at lunch or dinner time.\n  Therefore I would like to recognize Wawa as a Pennsylvania company \nwith a firm commitment to fighting hunger and serving the greater good. \nAt Thursday's grand opening, Wawa will announce its ``Lending a Helping \nHoagie Program,'' which will donate a portion of the new location's \nfirst week of hoagie sales to the Capital Area Food Bank. Along with \nthat program, Wawa will present the food bank with a grant of $10,000 \nto help launch its sustainable ``Fresh Community Market'' initiative.\n  Wawa's efforts in the fight against hunger do not end there. Its \nShare Donation Food Program is a smart, compassionate program that \nquickly distributes leftover hot food--that would otherwise go to \nwaste--to the communities that need it most. Additionally, until the \nend of this year, Wawa will continue its ``Check Out Hunger'' campaign \nthat allows customers to donate to Feeding America Food Banks at \ncheckout.\n  I am proud to say that this Pennsylvania institution, with the help \nof its loyal customers around the country, directly fights hunger in \nthe communities it serves. Wawa stands as an example of a company that \nrecognizes that its obligations do not end at its bottom line. It \ndemonstrates that corporations do not have to choose between being \nprosperous and undertaking initiatives to help communities. I applaud \nWawa for its commitment to fighting hunger, and hope that other \ncompanies will follow its example and find innovative ways to make a \ndifference in their community.\n"], "The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Davidson)": ["2018-04-17", "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Davidson).

The Senator from Alaska."], "Mr. MERKELY": ["2017-06-19", "  Mr. MERKELY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nwho is putting forth a powerful message about our values, and that is \nthat every child in America should have access to healthcare, and no \none in this Chamber should vote in a process or for a bill that \neviscerates that coverage. In fact, our value is that no one in \nAmerica, including our adults, including our older Americans, including \nour seniors, and including our children for sure--everyone should have \naccess to affordable healthcare and never have the stress of being \nworried that if their loved one gets sick, they might not receive the \ncare they need. They should never have the stress of concern that their \nfamily member might go bankrupt because they need medical care. It is \nthat value which we are here tonight fighting for, and it is that value \nwhich the Republican bill will destroy, ripping healthcare away from \nmillions of Americans. So we come here tonight with a battle cry, and \nthat cry is: No hearing, no vote. No hearing, no vote.\n  We are a democratic republic. We are a legislative Chamber. Have \nMembers of this Chamber forgotten that we are a ``we the people'' form \nof government where the people are in charge? The people are not in \ncharge if a secret 13 group of Senators is hiding in the basement \ncrafting a bill to rip healthcare away from millions of people. The \npeople are not in charge if they are afraid to show their bill to \neveryday Americans. They are not in charge if they are planning to \ndestroy healthcare so those with preexisting conditions can't gain \naccess to care.\n  Never have we seen a group in the majority so against the fundamental \nprinciples of our democratic Republic, so against the ``we the people'' \nvision of our Constitution, and that is why we are calling on them to \nstop, rethink, remember, absorb the values embedded in our beautiful \n``we the people'' Constitution. They want no public disclosure--fear of \nhow the public will respond. They want no committee hearings--fear of \nhow the people in America will respond. They want no committee \namendments because that will take time in which the people can see what \nis going on and respond. And they want no substantial floor \nconsideration in order to shove this through so they can go and \ncelebrate the Fourth of July with their constituents, while having \neviscerated the Constitution of the United States in the process of \nattending that Fourth of July gathering.\n  This has been called the vampire bill, the Republican vampire bill. \nWhy? Because the writers of it, the secret 13 writers, are afraid for \nthe bill to see the light of day. It is hiding in the darkness. And it \nis called the vampire bill because its general intent is to suck the \nlife out of the healthcare system for struggling families, suck the \nlife out of the healthcare system for working families and for middle-\nclass families.\n  This is quite different from the consideration when we created the \nsystem that we have now back in 2009. In that year, in the HELP \nCommittee--Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--there were \n47 hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs, a markup that went for more \nthan a month--the longest markup in that committee in the history of \nthe United States of America; a markup that considered over 300 \namendments; a markup with, in fact, a group of Senators, bipartisan, \nsitting around the table with the television cameras rolling while they \ndebated those amendments and voted on those amendments. And in that \ncommittee, they accepted or approved by vote more than 100 minority \namendments.\n  Then there is the Finance Committee, which held 53 hearings and \nroundtables. In fact, the minutes of the roundtable are available, and \nif you want to print them out and read them, they go for 800 pages--\njust the roundtable minutes. And then they had their own Finance \nCommittee markup, where they considered 135 amendments. Then the bill \ncame to the floor in December 2009, and there was 25 days of debate on \nthe floor.\n  Let's compare that to the plan of the majority leader and the secret \n13. Well, how many hearings do they want? They want zero in the HELP \nCommittee. How many hearings do they want in the Finance Committee? \nThey want zero. How many Democratic amendments do they want to \nconsider--or Republican amendments--in the HELP or Finance Committee? \nThe answer is zero. How much floor time do they want to have? They want \nto have just 1 day--just 1 day. They want to introduce it as an \namendment to the House TrumpCare bill and pass it on the same day. And \nhow many days do they want experts to be able to weigh in on a \nhealthcare system? Zero. But here is the most important zero of all: \nHow much time do they want for the American citizens to be able to see \nthis bill and respond to this bill? They want zero time. That is \ncompletely against all the premises of our responsibility as \nlegislators. It is against all the fundamental visions of a body that \nwill deliberate and debate and take into account the opinions of the \npeople and the insights of the experts.\n  Well, we can turn the clock back not so long ago to the majority \nleader, who said: ``Fast-tracking a major legislative overhaul such as \nhealthcare reform . . . without the benefit of a full and transparent \ndebate does a disservice to the American people.'' That was Majority \nLeader Mitch McConnell speaking not so long ago. What happened to that \nvalue? That was being said when we had 25 days of debate here\n\n\non the floor; when we had over 100 minority amendments--that is, \nRepublican amendments--accepted; when we had a lengthy debate in the \nFinance Committee and a lengthy debate in the HELP Committee, but the \nmajority leader wanted more time. Here he is today leading the effort \nto have zero input from the American public, zero input from healthcare \nexperts, zero committee deliberation, zero bipartisan discussion of the \npros and cons.\n  Well, we can turn to Paul Ryan. What did he think back in 2009? He \nsaid: ``Congress is moving fast to rush through a health care overhaul \nthat lacks a key ingredient: The full participation of you, the \nAmerican people.''\n  He went on to write: ``Congress and the White House have focused \ntheir public efforts on platitudes and press conferences, while the \nsubstance and the details have remained behind closed doors.''\n  Well, it was kind of a rewriting of history even at that moment in \ntime when he said that when there was a record-setting debate in the \nHELP Committee, the second longest debate in history in the Finance \nCommittee, television cameras running the whole time, 100 Republican \namendments adopted, more than 100 meetings and walkthroughs and \nroundtables and committee meetings, and 25 days on the floor. But Paul \nRyan said that what it was lacking was full participation of you, the \nAmerican people.\n  Well, if it was lacking in 2009, what do we say about this when the \nmajority deliberately wants to exclude the American people, when the \nAmerican people are standing at the door, when they are standing at the \nwindows and they are leaning in and saying: What is in this bill? We \nwant to have a say because it is so important to our families.\n  And the Republicans are slamming the door, and they are shuttering \nthe windows and saying: We will not share one word with you because we \nknow you won't like what we are doing.\n  That is not the way democracy is supposed to work.\n  Erin from Portland wrote because she has been diagnosed with diabetes \nand is terrified that if the Republican plan goes into effect, she \nwon't be able to afford coverage because of her preexisting condition. \nJeannette from Portland wrote. She is in her sixties and desperately \nwaiting to turn 65 and qualify for Medicare. She is on the Oregon \nHealth Plan and terrified that she will lose that plan before she \nqualifies for Medicare. The list goes on and on and on.\n  This weekend, I was out conducting townhall meetings in 4 different \ncounties of my 36 counties. I go to every county every year. And these \nfour counties are counties that voted--I am sorry to say--\noverwhelmingly against me when I ran for the U.S. Senate and \noverwhelmingly against me when I ran for reelection. They are red \ncounties; they are Republican counties.\n  Folks came out to my townhalls this weekend, and they sent one \nmessage to our Republican leadership in the Senate: We the American \npeople demand the chance to participate in this debate. It so \nprofoundly affects our quality of life.\n  So I carry their messages from Klamath County and from Lake County, \nand I carry their messages from Grant County and Wheeler County to the \nRepublican majority: Listen to the American people. Listen to rural \nAmerica. Listen to the families who will be devastated by the plan you \nare concocting with the secret 13. It is not right. It is not moral. In \nfact, we need to work together to improve healthcare, not to devastate \nit.\n  Thank you, Mr. President."], "The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Barr)": ["2017-12-05", "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Barr).

Cliff, thank you very, very much for your very kind \nwords. I am honored to receive this award. It is especially important \nbecause it comes from my peers, and I am humbled, given that prior \nrecipients of this award included such giants as Amo Houghton and Lee \nHamilton. My great thanks to you, the Executive Committee, and the \nboard of directors.\n  I am here to talk a little bit about the Congress to Campus program \nthat Cliff has already alluded to. It is our most impactful and \nimportant domestic program, and I am glad to report on it and also to \nadd some thoughts about the state of civic education across America.\n  What a year Congress to Campus has had during 2016 and 2017. Under \nthis program, bipartisan pairs of former Members visit college campuses \nfor several days to speak to students from all disciplines in a variety \nof settings, large and small.\n  We have three goals: to promote public service in the next generation \nof Americans, to teach about Congress and the work of a Member of \nCongress in ways that political science doesn't often capture, and to \nengage students in a discussion about the issues of the day.\n  The format demonstrates that a Republican and a Democrat can have \ndifferent points of view and opinions but still have a respectful \ndebate looking for common ground and a path forward.\n  Last fall, during the election season, the Former Members of Congress \nsent teams to 16 campuses. We had an additional 14 visits during the \nspring term. It was the busiest academic year in the 35-year history of \nthe program.\n  Former Members visited all over the U.S., from the University of \nMaine to Alcorn State in Mississippi and from the Naval Academy to \nArizona State. There were also four international Congress to Campus \nvisits.\n  Students come away with a better understanding of how Congress works \nand what the life of a Member of Congress is like. Sixty percent of the \nstudents report that their opinion of Congress improves after hearing \nfrom a bipartisan pair of former Members.\n  After hearing from such a visit, one student observed that \nRepublicans and Democrats aren't completely at odds and that they can \nwork together. That is certainly very different than the way the media \nportrays things. Another student came away with a sense of how \nimportant it was to be involved in public service.\n  In 2016, over 50 Members gave their time to speak to almost 7,000 \nstudents, not just at colleges in the Congress to Campus program, but \nalso students in high school and middle school. I want to thank my \ncolleagues on behalf of the Association for their participation in \nthese many visits.\n\n  Special thanks to the Former Members of Congress staff, particularly \nSharon Witiw, who is here in the Chamber, for nurturing this important \nprogram, for getting on us to participate and expanding it in \npartnership with our friends at the Stennis Center. We have come a long \nway since the years when a busy Congress to Campus year consisted of \ntwo or three visits per semester.\n\n\n  For these college audiences, we don't talk about how a bill becomes \nlaw but, rather, examine issues deeply and look into the politics of \ntoday's Congress. The program is civic education in practice.\n  I also need to report that more and more, during these visits, we \nencounter a lack of civic literacy, a lack of basic understanding of \nour Constitution and the structure and practice of American \nrepresentative democracy. It seems to be getting more pronounced every \nyear.\n  Our Association shares with many others across the country a growing \nconcern about the current state of civic knowledge and skill. Just last \nweek, the Annenberg Center at the University of Pennsylvania found in \nits survey that only a quarter of Americans can name all three branches \nof government and more than a third can't name any of the rights \nprotected by the First Amendment.\n  Lack of this sort of basic civic knowledge and skills probably has a \nrelationship to the current level of distrust in government and \nofficeholders. This has led the Association to look for possible \nsolutions.\n  Building on the civic ed admission of our Congress to Campus program, \nthe Association now intends to play a larger role in addressing civic \nilliteracy by reaching younger audiences in middle and secondary \nschools.\n  A bipartisan group of our Association came together for strategic \nplanning around this mission. Working with the Lou Frey Institute at \nthe University of Central Florida, the campaign for the Civic Mission \nof Schools, and Tufts University and facilitated by Pete Weichlein's \nwife--is she here today, Pete? No. Okay.--we developed a plan for how \nformer Members could be more actively involved.\n  This work has generated some exciting developments. Cliff has already \nshared the idea of a Congressional Study Group on Civics, which we \nintend to have bring together current Members, district directors, and \nchiefs of staff, bring them into our undertaking to advance civic \nlearning and practice.\n  Last week, the Association participated in a groundbreaking national \nsymposium on civics organized by our two partners, the campaign for the \nCivic Mission of Schools and the Lou Frey Institute, where funders and \nmany civic organizations exchanged ideas and renewed their commitments \nto improving our common efforts to educate for democracy.\n  Pete and I were there and had the privilege, on behalf of our \nAssociation, to commit us to making civic education the centerpiece of \nthe Former Members of Congress' domestic programs, and Pete will be on \neach and all of us to make good on that promise.\n  We have a steering committee of former Members committed to the \neffort. My friends and colleagues, George Nethercutt, Jim Gerlach, Bill \nSarpalius, Tom Coleman, Karen Thurman, Steve Horsford, and Mickey \nEdwards join me on that committee. We will convene soon to discuss what \nformer and current Members can do together to make a difference and to \nissue a call to arms to our membership. Consider yourselves forewarned. \nI am looking at you, Dan Glickman.\n  By exemplifying bipartisanship and taking advantage of the networks \nwe still have, former Members can make a tremendous contribution to \naddressing the core need of American democracy: preparing our young \npeople for active citizenship. I look forward to reporting to you again \nnext year on our progress.\n  More importantly, we need to engage all of you in this effort. Our \npeople's lack of understanding of our own system of government has \nbecome pervasive, and it threatens the Republic. It explains much of \nwhat ails us politically.\n  Cliff, thank you very much for your leadership of the Association and \nfor the opportunity to give this report."], "Ms. MORELLA": ["2017-09-27", "  Ms. MORELLA. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Cliff, for the \nintroduction and all of your comments, and particularly for your \nleadership of Former Members of Congress during this year. You have \ndone a superlative job.\n  Well, as you know, Former Members of Congress works with all Members \nof the congressional family. Our network also includes current Members \nof Congress and their senior staff to promote a collaborative, \nbipartisan, and effective approach to policymaking both at home and \nabroad.\n  Our flagship programs for our colleagues who are still in office are \nthe Congressional Study Groups on Germany, Japan, and Europe. The \nCongressional Study Groups are independent, bipartisan legislative \nexchanges that strive to create better understanding and cooperation \nbetween the United States and our most important strategic and economic \npartners abroad.\n  Each study group has a membership roster of between 75 and 125 \nMembers of Congress, and it is led by a bipartisan, bicameral pair of \nco-chairs who are currently in Congress. Our model celebrates active \ndiscussions among all participants, avoiding lengthy speeches or formal \npresentations, in order to create an atmosphere that promotes personal \nconnections. We believe that the network of peers created via our \nprograms have acted to renew and expand areas of mutual cooperation, \nespecially in times of transition.\n  The Congressional Study Groups are not the only programs dedicated to \nthis mission, but they are unique in their year-round outreach to \nCapitol Hill. Unlike other formats, we provide long-lasting staff \nsupport and maintain a well-respected reputation as independent and \nnon-advocacy. As a result, our network attracts a large, diverse group \nof legislators and policymakers who are committed to international \ndialogue. What is most important for us is that they join the \ndiscussion.\n  A few highlights from the 114th Congress:\n  We hosted 62 roundtables in Washington, D.C., which are the \nfoundation of our programming. Maintaining a year-round outreach \nensures that we are developing meaningful relationships instead of \nhaving occasional encounters.\n  108 Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate and 204 \nsenior congressional staffers participated in at least one of those \nroundtables; most participated in multiple programs.\n  We also organized 12 study tours abroad for Members of Congress and \nsenior congressional staff because we know that immersive travel \nexperiences have immense value.\n  Each trip is an opportunity for mutual learning and sharing, as well \nas forming bonds, with meeting partners and within the bipartisan \ndelegation itself, and we know that is important.\n  Already, our programming calendar in the 115th Congress has been \nbusy. In the first 6 months of 2017, we have organized three study \ntours for Members of Congress and three study tours for senior \ncongressional staff.\n  Our roundtables on Capitol Hill also recently welcomed several senior \nofficials, including the German Federal Minister of Economic Affairs \nand Energy, the chairman and CEO of Lufthansa, and a high-level \ndelegation from the Japanese Diet.\n  I would like to acknowledge the service of all of our co-chairs for \ntheir hard work and dedication to these critical programs. Our co-\nchairs are true leaders, who not only serve in their role as official \nStudy Group leaders, but are also called on by various embassies and \noutside organizations to speak on panels, attend roundtables, and meet \nwith countries who have visiting delegations.\n  The Congressional Study Group on Germany is led by Senator Jeanne \nShaheen, Representative Charlie Dent, and Representative Ted Deutch. We \nthank the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, for his service as a Senate \nco-chair until February 2017.\n  The Congressional Study Group on Japan is led by Senator Mazie K. \nHirono, Senator Lisa Murkowski, Representative Diana DeGette, and \nRepresentative Billy Long.\n  The Congressional Study Group on Europe is led by Senator John \nBoozman, Senator Chris Murphy, Representative Jeff Fortenberry, and \nRepresentative Peter Welch. We very much appreciate all their efforts \nin leadership.\n  I also want to mention that our work is not limited to the three main \nStudy Groups on Germany, Japan, and Europe. For example, over the past \n6 months, we have put a lot of energy into bringing Korea-focused \nprogramming to Capitol Hill. I don't have to tell you how important our \nrelationship with South Korea is, and the many security and trade \nissues that shape this part of the world.\n  We, therefore, in addition to our ongoing focus on China, have \ncommenced programming on Korea. We are very fortunate to have former \nMember Jay Kim chair this effort in Korea itself, and his leadership \nalready has resulted in a number of incredibly informative Capitol Hill \nprograms involving former and current Members.\n  The work of the Congressional Study Groups is complemented by our \nDiplomatic Advisory Council. Initially focused on European nations, the \nDiplomatic Advisory Council is now comprised of approximately 30 \nambassadors from four continents who advise and participate in our \nprogramming. Their interest and commitment to multilateral dialogues is \na very valuable addition to the Congressional Study Groups and provides \na valuable outreach beyond our three Study Groups.\n  At the beginning of the 114th Congress, we also formed the \nCongressional Staff Advisory Council. As former Members of Congress, we \nknow the value of good staff. I always say my rock and my staff, they \nsupport me. The Staff Advisory Council formally recognizes the mutually \nbeneficial relationships we have in offices across Capitol Hill. We are \nas grateful for the staff who participate in and support our group \nprogramming as we are for the Members of Congress.\n  Finally, I would like to add a thanks to those individuals, \norganizations, and corporations whose patronage makes our work \npossible. In particular, I would like to recognize Ambassador Jim \nZumwalt and Ms. Junko Chano of Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA, Dr. Karen \nDonfried and Reta Jo Lewis of The German Marshall Fund of the United \nStates, and Ms. Paige Cottingham-Streater of the Japanese-U.S. \nFriendship Committee for their tremendous support as institutional \nfunders of the Congressional Study Groups in 2017.\n  Companies that belong to the 2017 Business Advisory Councils are: \nAllianz, All Nippon Airways, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, BASF, B. \nBraun Medical, Central Japan Railway Company, Cheniere Energy, Daimler, \nDeutsche Telekom, DHL, Evonik Corporation, Fresenius Medical Care North \nAmerica, Fresenius SE, Hitachi, Honda, Lockheed Martin, Lufthansa \nGerman Airlines, Marubeni America Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation \n(Americas), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America, Mitsui, Nissan, \nPanasonic, RatnerPrestia, the Representative of German Industry and \nTrade, Sojitz, Toyota Motor North America, UPS, and Volkswagen of \nAmerica.\n  Because of their financial support, our activities not only help to \nbuild vital bilateral relationships between legislatures, but also \nbuild bipartisan relationships within our own Congress. Mutual \nunderstanding and shared experiences among legislators are crucial, as \nyou know, to solving pressing problems, whether at home or abroad.\n  As former Members of Congress, we are proud to bring the important \nservices provided by the Congressional Study Groups to our colleagues \nwho are still in office, and are proud to play an active role in our \ncontinued international outreach.\n  So I want to thank you, Cliff. I want to thank all of the Members who \nare here. Continuing these very important programs is important, and we \nthank you for that."], "Mr. HERTEL": ["2017-09-27", "  Mr. HERTEL. Thank you, Cliff.\n  Let me associate myself with Connie Morella's remarks. Your \nleadership of FMC has been exemplary, and your report today is a \ntribute to our great energy and commitment. On behalf of our \nAssociation, thank you very much, Connie.\n  I want to thank Speaker Ryan for what he said today about coming to \nvisit us, but also talking about our being ambassadors to the Nation. I \nthink we are, not only the Nation, but worldwide, about the Congress \nand how proud we are of the Congress and the democracy that we have \nhere, and even with our great differences in today's world, how we \ncarry on and represent the people and commend the Congress for doing \nso.\n  I am tremendously pleased to share with our colleagues an update on \nour charitable golf tournament. As Cliff mentioned, I, along with Ken \nKramer, co-chair the event, which is now in its 11th year.\n  Back in 2006, we had low attendance. It was just a competitive match \nthat we had between Republicans and Democrats out at Andrews Air Force \nBase and very private. We were dwindling in our attendance, and we \nthought maybe we could change this and make it into something effective \nfor the community.\n  We were able to transform it into something that was fun but also, \nmore importantly, inspirational, where the focus was not just on your \ngolfing ability. I am the example. I am not a golfer. I have co-chaired \nthis for 10 years with Ken now, but I am the worst duffer you could \nhave out there, yet the Democrats still won even with me on their team \nthis year.\n  It has become successful. As of today, the tournament has raised \nalmost $1.3 million to help veterans and their families deal with \ninjuries sustained during the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.\n  The two beneficiaries of the money raised, Warfighters Sports, a \ndivision of Disabled Sports USA who helps with 120 different sports for \ntheir members across this Nation who have been injured in defending our \ncountry, and Tee it Up for the Troops, are two outstanding \norganizations that use adaptive sports as a way for severely wounded \nveterans to reengage with their families and communities and get a bit \nof their prewar activity back into their lives. These guys go skiing, \nthey go mountain climbing, horseback riding. You name it, they do it. \nWe are so proud of the men and women and what they have accomplished.\n  We are proud that for the last 3 years, we have shared this honor of \nco-chairing the tournament with Congressman Jimmy Duncan of Tennessee, \nwho I am sorry to see is retiring now--he has just been an excellent \nchairman and a great friend to all of us all these years--and \nCongressman Gene Green of Texas, who has just been an outstanding \nleader and is going to continue with us, I hope. He is just so \nenthusiastic in getting Members out there.\n  They are the ones who recruit the current Members of Congress, and \nthey bug them and hassle them every week to get them out to our \ntournament. We have had more people, more Members at our tournament \nthan other golf tournaments. There are so many different tournaments \nhere in Washington that have Members play, but we have had the greatest \nturnout over the years.\n  It is unlike any other golf tournament. There is still a little \nfriendly competition. As I said, the Democrats won this year. I can't \nsay that enough, because we lost for the past 7 years prior. And, you \nknow, Republicans belong to more country clubs than Democrats, anyway. \nI think they have more experience.\n  More importantly, we have had over 30 wounded veterans play this last \nyear, and every year in our tournament, so many wounded veterans, and \nit is just inspirational.\n  I played with a veteran from Michigan, a young man who had been in \nAfghanistan 2 weeks on the Army police force there, and lost his leg in \na bomb explosion. And he was out there playing golf. Just an \noutstanding golfer, outstanding American, and to share that day with \nhim has just been an honor for all of us.\n  So we are already working now on the tournament for next year. It \nwill be April of next year. We hope we get more former Members out. As \nI have said, we have done really well with current Members of Congress, \nbut what we need is to get more former Members out. It doesn't matter \nour age or our ability. Even if you can just come out for the day and \nspend it with the veterans, you know, watching the match and having \nlunch and dinner and breakfast with the Members and, more importantly, \nthe veterans, that is really worthwhile. If you bring your family out \nthere too for a while, that is fine too. It is always at the Army and \nNavy Club, so it is convenient.\n  We finish early. We start early. We start at 8 and we finish about 4 \nin the afternoon, so we leave before the rush hour traffic so the \nMembers can get back here for a vote. So we would love to have you come \nout even for a few hours if you have the time.\n  Ken Kramer, Pete Weichlein and I back in 2006 wondered whether we \ncould change our existing tournament to something more meaningful, and \ndecided to transform the golf event from a highly competitive Members \nonly tournament to a fun and inspirational fundraiser, where the focus \nwas not on your golfing ability, but rather on coming together, on a \nbipartisan basis, former and current Members alike, for a great cause. \nI think I can speak for Ken and Pete when I say that we have succeeded \nbeyond our wildest dreams. As of today the tournament has raised almost \n$1.3 million to help veterans and their families deal with injuries \nsustained during the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. The two beneficiaries \nof the money raised, Warfighters Sports, a division of Disabled Sports \nUSA, and Tee it Up for the Troops are two outstanding organizations \nthat use adaptive sports as a way for severely wounded warriors to re-\nengage with their families and communities and get a bit of their pre-\nwar activity back into their lives.\n  Both Ken Kramer and I have had the honor to be cochair of this \ntournament for the past 10 years, and we are proud that the last three \nyears we have shared this honor with Congressman Jimmy Duncan of \nTennessee and Congressman Gene Green of Texas. Jimmy and Gene are \ninstrumental in recruiting current Members to the tournament. This \ntournament is unlike any other golf tournament. Although there still is \na little friendly competition with the Speakers Cup, which the \nDemocrats won this year after several years of losing to the \nRepublicans, the day is all about the vets. Over 30 wounded veterans \nplayed in the tournament. It is quite amazing to see a wounded warrior, \nfor example, someone who has lost a leg, drive the ball like a pro, \nout-shooting everyone in the foursome, or be inspired with stories of \nthe courage you hear while playing a round of golf with a warrior \nsuffering from traumatic brain injury. The tournament we hosted earlier \nthis year was our most successful yet, with the greatest number of \nplayers and the largest dollar amount raised, and we already are \nworking on the next tournament in April 2018.\n  Before I yield the floor back to Cliff, let me thank him and Martin \nFrost for their incredible leadership on our annual gala event, the \nStatesmanship Awards Dinner. Cliff is FMC's president and Martin is the \nevent's chairman. They work tirelessly on making the dinner a signature \nevent here in D.C., and, more importantly, a huge successful evening \nfor all of us.\n  As you all know, we do not receive any funding from Congress, as \nCliff pointed out again this morning. Not a single taxpayer dollar is \nearmarked for any of our programs, which, in my opinion, is exactly the \nway it should be. We are independent, we raise our own money, and our \nformer Members donate their time pro bono for all the different \nprograms that we have. As Cliff went over, we had former Members donate \nto us an astounding 6,500 hours of pro bono public service, even \nwithout the need to cover an honorarium. Running all of our outstanding \nprograms does cost a lot of money and staff time. Therefore, in \naddition to\n\n\nfoundation grants, the Statesmanship Awards Dinner is an incredibly \nimportant piece of FMC's budgetary puzzle.\n  Over the years, I have heard so many of our former Members talk about \nhow much they appreciate our staff and how wonderful our staff is and \nhow they accomplish what would take ten-fold another staff to do. We \nthink it is the best staff in Washington. That is saying a lot, \nconsidering all the other competitive nonprofits that are successful \nhere in Washington.\n  So the way that we can show our appreciation for the staff and what \nthey have accomplished and what they are doing for us and what they are \ndoing for our country is this dinner. That is the one thing that we can \nall demonstrate our support at, because it pays their salaries. So if \nyou appreciate what they do and you think they deserve a bonus, the \nbest way to help them and to improve our Association is to help us sell \ntickets for this dinner.\n  Under Martin Frost's chairmanship this last year, our 20th annual \ndinner, we had the most successful event ever. It was getting to be \nkind of the same old thing, and Pete Weichlein, our executive director \nwho spearheaded this effort, said let's change it up, let's move it to \nthe Mellon Auditorium, which has been a tremendous, majestic setting, \nand let's have some outside awardees that we honor too. Let's not just \nhave a boring program where we have people get up and receive an award \nand give a thank-you speech and then take pictures. Let's have a panel \ndiscussion instead so we can involve the audience and take some \nquestions and we all stay awake and people don't sneak out early, \nbecause it is interesting to hear that panel discussion.\n  That is what Pete Weichlein has created now, and I think it is those \ntwo decisions that we now have the signature event here in Washington. \nWe have something that we are proud of where we see more and more \npeople come, more and more active Members come, people from the \nadministration, past Members come. The Speaker has been supportive, the \nmajority leader, minority leaders have been supportive in so many ways. \nI just think it is a way that we get to talk about what we do to a \nbroader audience, and for them actually to say thank you to us by \ncoming to that dinner.\n  We now have a dinner that has become a signature event here in D.C., \na classy and substantive evening of which all of us can be very proud. \nThe only thing missing is to make it a black-tie evening, and maybe \nthat is something we can consider for the future. It is that \nsophisticated an event.\n  So Martin and Cliff have already put things in place to make the 2018 \ndinner even more outstanding. They should be commended for their \nefforts. I, along with the other former Members serving on the event's \nsteering committee, are committed to helping them. I hope all the \nformer Members here today will take a closer look at the dinner and \ndecide to become more involved.\n  We are recognizing via this dinner the tremendous power of \nbipartisanship, something that Speaker Ryan talked about that is so \nimportant to all of us, and it really is exemplified in that dinner \nevery year by the awards that we give, by the discussion we have, and \nby the people that attend.\n  So this year we are going to be honoring as honorees Senators Lamar \nAlexander and Patty Murray, along with House Members Diana DeGette and, \nmy good friend, Fred Upton from Michigan. We will host a conversation \nof our honorees on stage again so that those in attendance can hear \nabout their success reaching across the political aisle and working \ntogether for the good of the country. They are able to tell stories \nabout exactly how they accomplish things and what they did and the kind \nof personal relationships that they have and why that makes a \ndifference, the kind of thing that we know about, that we want to reach \nthe larger world so that they understand that things are done by \nindividuals working together, and not by speeches and by fundraising \nalone, but by Members of Congress being effective and caring about \nmoving the ball forward.\n  The 21st Annual Statesmanship Awards Dinner is one of the most \nimpressive in town. You will not regret becoming involved. You will see \nmore of your former colleagues from both the House and the Senate, as \nwell as ambassadors. Connie Morella has brought more ambassadors to \nthat dinner and more administration officials and former officials than \never before.\n  I am thinking of Speaker Ryan. A lot of us served with his former \nboss, Jack Kemp. Jack Kemp was in the Reagan administration and was \nsuch a leader. It just flows down from people who have served before \ncarrying that torch forward, and I think Speaker Ryan is a great \nexample of that. So the dinner exemplifies that, and it has become an \nincreasingly impressive event, showcasing our Association.\n  I hope all of you will join Martin and all the hard work he is doing. \nHe will push us. He is really good at pushing us. He did that when he \ndid it for the Democrats. He is a fundraiser. Now he does it, very \nimportantly, for our Association. We would like that muscle to be used \nin a bipartisan way now.\n  Cliff's leadership is outstanding across the board and tireless. So \nthank you very much. We are looking forward to a great dinner in 2018."], "Mr. RAHALL": ["2017-09-27", "  Mr. RAHALL.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 974, the \nBoosting Rates of American Veteran Employment Act, which I introduced \nalong with Congressman and Colonel Paul Cook of California.\n  The BRAVE Act is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will \nauthorize the VA Secretary, when awarding Federal contracts, to give \npreference to contractors with high concentrations of full-time veteran \nemployees. This bill will cost taxpayers absolutely nothing.\n  It will, first, reward companies that actively hire and invest in our \nveterans, companies that seek out veterans and give them opportunities \nto bring their unique skills, training, and experience to the civilian \nworkforce.\n  Second, it will create an incentive for other companies to do the \nsame and bring more veterans into their workforce.\n  Most importantly, as more and more companies hire more and more \nveterans, they will ultimately see that investing in veterans is good \nfor business. That is the real incentive here. It is not just an \nadvantage in securing Federal contracts; it is getting the benefit of \nemployees who have worn the uniform, who have been trained by the \ngreatest military in the world, and who have learned to get the job \ndone, no matter what that job is.\n  We need more businesses in the private sector to recognize the value \nof investing in the men and women who have served our country. It is \nnot an act of charity. Veterans are not looking for a handout; they \njust need an opportunity. The BRAVE Act will help ensure that more \nveterans have those opportunities.\n  I want to thank Chairman Roe of Tennessee, Vice Chairman Bilirakis, \nand Ranking Member Walz for supporting this bill and for helping to \nbring it to the floor today.\n  This legislation passed unanimously in the last Congress, and I urge \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to, once again, give it the \nbipartisan support it deserves."], "The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley)": ["2017-06-27", "  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley).

During his Congressional service, \nhe was Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture from 1981 to 1994 and \nRanking Member of the Committee from 1995 to 1997. De la Garza was a \nfounding member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n   At the age of 17, de la Garza joined the United States Navy and \nserved for two years, including the final months of World War II. Upon \nreturning home, he completed his high school education before attending \nEdinburg Junior College and St. Mary's University in San Antonio. While \nat St. Mary's, de la Garza was again deployed, this time to the Korean \nWar where he was an artillery officer in the United States Army.

He also stood up for \nthe disenfranchised, supporting landmark civil rights legislation that \nled to important progress for our society. Born and raised in the Rio \nGrande Valley, de la Garza understood the importance of maintaining \nstrong international relations and was a staunch supporter of the U.S.-\nMexico relationship. He was the first Member of Congress to receive \nMexico's Order of the Aztec Eagle Award and Israel's Vulcan Center's \nLifetime Achievement Award--both awards recognized his efforts to \ncultivate stronger, more constructive ties between the United States \nand its allies.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nwith my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, that would \nreauthorize the only federally funded programs specifically designed to \ndevelop a health provider workforce to care for older Americans. The \nGeriatrics Workforce Improvement Act would reauthorize the Geriatrics \nWorkforce Enhancement Program, known as GWEP, and also reinstate the \nGeriatric Academic Career Awards program, known as GACA.\n  The number of Americans aged 65 and older is growing rapidly. In \nMaine, we are reaching an aging milestone faster than other States--by \n2020, the number of seniors is projected to outnumber children. This is \n15 years aheadV the national projected date of 2035, at which point the \nnumber of Americans 65 and older will outnumber those under age 18 for \nthe first time in U.S. history.\n  The United States is facing a critical shortage of geriatric health \nprofessionals and direct service workers to support our aging \npopulation. Today, we need 20,000 geriatricians; however, fewer than \n7,300 of our Nation's nearly one million physicians are board-certified \ngeriatricians. By 2030, we will need 3.1,000 geriatricians and even \nmore geriatric health professionals and direct service workers. We need \nto train 1,600 geriatricians per year over the next 12 years to reach \nthe targeted need by 2030.\n  As many as 90 percent of older adults are expected to have one or \nmore chronic health conditions. Multiple chronic conditions, multiple \nmedications, and changes that occur in aging make caring for older \nadults complex and challenging, yet also rewarding to healthcare \nprofessionals who choose this specialty. In any given year, it is \nexpected that 30 percent of older adults and their families will \nrequire specialized geriatric care.\n  Today there are 44 geriatric workforce enhancement programs or GWEPs \nin 29 states. GWEP sites include 25 schools of medicine, ten schools of \nnursing, five healthcare facilities, two schools of allied health, a \nschool of social work, and a certified nurse assistant program. GWEPs \nhave the flexibility to tailor training in geriatrics to the unique \nneeds of their own communities.\n  GWEP programs focus on Geriatric Education by:\n  1. Changing clinical training environments so that geriatrics is \nintegrated into primary care delivery systems;\n  2. Training providers to assess and address the needs of older \nadults, their families, and caregivers at multiple levels within their \ncommunities;\n  3. Delivering community-based programs for patients, families and \ncaregivers; and\n  4. Providing Alzheimer's disease education for families and \ncaregivers, including direct care workers and other providers.\n  In 2016, the 44 GWEPs produced significant outcomes. They provided \ncontinuing education courses to 94,000 practicing public health \nprofessionals, from disciplines such as medicine, nursing, allied \nhealth, heath services administration, social work, and psychology. \nThey have also created opportunities for healthcare providers in rural \nand underserved areas to learn from and consult with top experts in \ngeriatric care through tele-consults, and educational webcasts, as well \nas online geriatric education programs that are publicly available and \naccessible online, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for free.\n  GACA programs focus on Resource Optimization. Established in 1998, \nGACA programs were funded to increase the number of faculty engaged in \ngeriatric education. Transitioning from clinical training and practice \ninto an academic faculty role is particularly challenging, and requires \ngaining new skills as an educator. These skills are not typically \ntaught in clinical training programs.\n  Following a restructuring of the geriatric workforce program, GACA \nhas gone unfunded since 2015. GACA would be reauthorized as a stand-\nalone resource within our legislation in order to optimize future \ngrowth and stability of early-career geriatric faculty. GACA supports \nearly career development for emerging leaders by providing funding that \nsupports 50 percent of their effort to develop skills as an inter-\nprofessional educator in geriatrics.\n  The Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act would reauthorize the GWEP \nprogram at $45 million per year over the next five years, and reinstate \nGACA at $6 million per year. Together, these programs would train the \ncurrent workforce and family caregivers, while simultaneously \ndeveloping a cadre of emerging leaders in geriatric education, in a \nvariety of disciplines. By doing both, we will assure that older \nAmericans will be cared for by a health care workforce specifically \ntrained to meet their unique and complex health needs for decades to \ncome. This training to use the most efficient and effective methods for \nolder adults will result in improved care while saving valuable \nresources, and reducing unnecessary costs.\n  Exposure to geriatrics, particularly through pre-clinical and \nclinical education, has been identified as an important factor for \nincreasing interest in the field. This exposure provides faculty the \nopportunities needed to demonstrate the specialty is a viable, complex, \nyet rewarding specialty. The Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act would \nprovide these critical platforms by creating the infrastructure needed \nto attract the best and the brightest into the field of geriatrics.\n  This legislation already has broad support. I ask to enter into the \nrecord a letter of support from the National Association for Geriatric \nEducation and the National Association of Geriatric Education Centers.\n  Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan \nlegislation that would ensure geriatric education for our current \nworkforce, while optimizing resources to bolster academic careers in \ngeriatrics. Together, GWEP and GACA would develop a high-quality \ngeriatric workforce ready to provide care for Americans as we grow \nolder.\n\n         National Association for Geriatric Education, National \n           Association of Geriatric Education Centers,\n                                                     May 21, 2018.\n     Hon.

The \n     National Association for Geriatric Education (NAGE) is \n     pleased to offer our support for this important legislation, \n     which will reauthorize the GWEP and once again make the \n     Geriatrics Academic Career Award program (GACA) a part of the \n     effort\n\n\n     to prepare the geriatrics workforce for the aging of our \n     population. We and the growing numbers of older adults, \n     caregivers, and clinicians caring for elders will urge \n     Congress to move quickly to pass your bill and provide the \n     resources to address our nation's growing demand for \n     geriatric care.\n       We appreciate the many discussions that your staff \n     facilitated with NAGE, as well as with the Eldercare \n     Workforce Alliance, the American Geriatrics Society, and The \n     Gerontological Society of America during the process of \n     developing this legislation. This authorization and related \n     funding is needed for the development of a health care \n     workforce specifically trained to care for older adults and \n     to support their family caregivers. Currently there are only \n     44 GWEP sites in 29 states. The modest increase in the \n     authorization in your bill will have an important impact on \n     training in geriatric care. Likewise, the funds you have \n     authorized for the GACA program will assist in ensuring that \n     rural and underserved areas will have geriatrics education \n     programs.\n       NAGE is a non-profit membership organization representing \n     GWEP sites, Centers on Aging, and Geriatric Education Centers \n     that provide education and training to health professionals \n     in the areas of geriatrics and gerontology. Our mission is to \n     help America's healthcare workforce be better prepared to \n     render age-appropriate care to today's older Americans and \n     those of tomorrow.\n       Thank you for your continued support for geriatric \n     education programs.\n           Sincerely,\n     Maura Brennan, MD, FACP, AGSF, FAAHPM, CHMD,\n       President NAGE/NAGEC; Project Director, Baystate Health, \n     Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program; Chief, Div. of \n     Geriatrics, Palliative Care & Post-Acute Medicine; Prof. of \n     Medicine, Univ. of Massachusetts-Baystate; Adjunct Prof. of \n     Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine.\n"], "The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Gianforte)": ["2018-03-06", "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Gianforte).

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nCapito, to introduce the Stopping Suspicious Orders of Opioids Act.\n  In 2016, the opioid epidemic caused more than 42,000 deaths in the \nUnited States.\n  In 2017, this epidemic was declared a public health emergency.\n  Now, more than 400 State, local, and Tribal governments have filed \nsuits (some consolidated, some individual) against opioid manufacturers \nand distributors for their alleged roles in fueling and perpetuating \nthis devastating crisis. The U.S. Justice Department, or DOJ, has filed \na statement of interest in these lawsuits, which are currently pending.\n  As our Nation struggles to effectively address the opioid epidemic, \none thing is clear: there is no silver bullet.\n  Yet, it is also clear that law enforcement can play a critical role \nin preventing and reducing overdose deaths.\n  That is why we must ensure that law enforcement has and uses the \nnecessary tools to hold opioid manufacturers, distributors and others \naccountable when they fail to properly disclose to the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, or the DEA, opioid orders that are suspicious because \nof their size, frequency, or patterns. This simple disclosure could \nprevent millions of prescription opioid pills from ending up on the \nblack market.\n  Unfortunately, current law has inadvertently created a standard that \nis too high for DOJ to meet in order to take immediate action against \nthose who fail to make these disclosures to the DEA or who fail to \nadequately protect against diversion.\n  For instance, the DEA has told my staff that under current law, in \norder to immediately stop a drug manufacturer or distributor from \ndistributing opioids, a pharmacy from dispensing opioids, or a \npractitioner from prescribing opioids, it must prove that the \ndistribution, dispensation, or prescription of the drugs directly \nresulted in an immediate and substantial likelihood that death, serious \nbodily harm, or abuse of a controlled substance occurred.\n  For this reason, the bill Senator Capito and I are introducing today \nwould change the standard in current law to make it easier to \nimmediately stop potentially dangerous shipments of prescription \nopioids. It would allow DOJ to take action when it can demonstrate that \nan opioid manufacturer or distributor's lack of control over a \nprescription opioid would likely result in the drugs winding up in the \nhands of someone other than the intended recipient or on the black \nmarket.\n  This change will compel opioid manufacturers and distributors to be \nmore vigilant in their efforts to report and stop the delivery of \nsuspicious orders of opioids as well as to protect against diversion. \nIn the absence of such vigilance, our bill would allow DOJ to \nimmediately stop the delivery of opioids.\n  Our bill further ensures that bad actors are held accountable by \nestablishing backstops and consequences for when opioid manufacturers, \ndistributors, dispensers, and prescribers fail to take corrective \naction.\n  Under current law, if there is no immediate threat to the public \nhealth or safety, opioid manufacturers, distributors, dispensers and \nprescribers can submit a corrective action plan to DOJ before their \nregistrations can be revoked or suspended. DOJ does not have to accept \nthis plan, but if it does, current law does not outline a timeframe by \nwhich the plan must be fully implemented or consequences for failure to \ndo so.\n  Given the magnitude of the opioid epidemic, this is unacceptable.\n  That is why our bill would require those who manufacture, distribute, \ndispense or prescribe opioids to fully implement any plan that is \naccepted by DOJ within 30 days. Failure to do so will result in the \nimmediate suspension of a registration until the reinstated proceedings \nto deny, revoke, or suspend the registration permanently have \nconcluded.\n  Mr. President, I have been struck by the seemingly countless examples \nof opioid manufacturers and distributors that have done little to \nsafeguard\n\n\nagainst diversion that have been raised in hearings, roundtables, and \nin the news over the last several years.\n  The example most often cited is that of Kermit, West Virginia, where, \nover a two year period nine million opioids were delivered to a single \npharmacy. Between 2007 and 2012, 780 million oxycodone and hydrocodone \npills were delivered to pharmacies throughout that state. This resulted \nin 1,728 fatal overdoses that were largely preventable.\n  We cannot allow this to happen again.\n  The bill Senator Capito and I are introducing today will strengthen \ncurrent law by providing law enforcement with the additional tools it \nneeds to better and more proactively combat the opioid epidemic and \nhold bad actors accountable.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.-\n"], "The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Lamborn)": ["2018-04-25", "  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Lamborn).

I support \nit.\n  For too long, our veterans could really question whether this \ngovernment means it when we say that we value their service. We cannot \nerase those doubts in one day or in one bill, but we can take a \npositive step forward, and we are doing that today. Both parties are \ndoing that together.\n  Together, we are finally giving all caregivers the tools they need \nfor the heroic work that they do. We are strengthening VA at its core \nby attracting the best and the brightest to work there, and we are \ngiving veterans a real choice to seek the best treatment anywhere, \nwhether in or outside of the VA.\n  This is a good bill, but it is not perfect. We owe it to our veterans \nand to the taxpayers to explain how we will pay for this.\n  There is a strict cap on VA's budget, and the MISSION Act will bust \nthat cap, so all of the good things in the MISSION Act will trigger \nharsh, automatic cuts in the rest of VA's budget. This will force the \nVA to rob Peter to pay Paul.\n  This is not hypothetical. One year from now, these cuts will be \ntriggered, and a veteran today would be right to ask if his favorite \nnurse will be laid off or if the old and slow computer systems at the \nVA will get even older and even slower. The money has to come from \nsomewhere in the VA's budget.\n  But there is another way. The money we are spending today does not \nhave to count against the budget cap. That budget cap was set before we \never made these improvements to the VA. It is a separate issue, and the \ncap number shouldn't hold us back. My bill, H.R. 5805, would simply \ncount the new money as separate so that it does not bust the rest of \nthe VA's budget.\n  Mr. Speaker, both sides of this House are working together to improve \nthe VA. That is a great thing. Let's not make it any harder than it \nalready is. Instead, let's finish the job. We have to spend what it \ntakes to get the job done. No more, but also no less.\n  Our veterans are looking to us to make the VA stronger, not weaker. \nThe workers of the VA are depending upon us to give them what they need \nfor their mission. Automatic budget cuts will not accomplish that \nmission.\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides to help us, help our veterans, and \nhelp our workers.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today as chair of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus Health Braintrust to commemorate National Minority Health \nMonth and to challenge Congress to take bold action to end health \ndisparities that continue to plague our communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is a sad fact that in America your race, class, and \nZIP Code very much determine how long you will live and how healthy you \nwill be; whether you will die of a heart attack in your forties or \ndevelop type 2 diabetes and lose a limb.\n  These three factors speak volumes about your life and health. That is \njust wrong, and it is up to us to change that.\n  From cradle to grave, and at every stage in between, people of color, \nlow-income people, rural Americans, Native Americans, and first-\ngeneration Americans are sicker, receive less care, have less access to \ncare, and, tragically, die sooner.\n  In 2010, we took a major leap forward with the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act. This law has started to reduce these disparities \nby increasing access to care, ensuring mental healthcare, expanding \nresearch, and creating a\n\n\npipeline of doctors and medical professionals from underrepresented \ncommunities.\n\n  A major result of the ACA has been to cut the excessive risk of \ncancer death in half for African-American men. The same risk factor for \nBlack women was reduced by seven points, according to the American \nCancer Society's 2017 report.\n  They clearly state: ``Increasing access to care as a result of the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act may contribute to a further \nnarrowing of the racial gap across all population groups.''\n  However, the ACA is not just fighting cancer. It is improving other \naspects of care and increasing access to care.\n  While the Affordable Care Act has made major strides, disparities \nremain deeply entrenched in our society and our healthcare system \ntoday.\n  Today, I would like to talk about several of them. The first and most \nentrenched is access to care. Far too often, the sickest among our \nneighbors are those with the least access to the care they need. They \ncannot see a provider because they can't afford it, can't get the time \noff work, can't find transportation; or there is simply no care \navailable in their community.\n  Let's work together to make sure that everyone can get the care they \nneed, no matter where they live, whether in a city, the suburbs, or on \na farm.\n  This Minority Health Month, we must also address the challenge of \nmental health being stigmatized in communities of color.\n  We know that African Americans are 20 percent more likely to report \nserious psychological distress than their White counterparts, but just \n25 percent will seek care, compared to 40 percent of White Americans.\n  Thankfully, there are some great organizations, like New York City's \nFirst Lady Chirlane McCray's Cities Thrive Coalition, working to \ndeconstruct the stigma and improve access to care, but much work \nremains.\n  Just like with mental health, another health subset, maternal health, \nshows stark differences between different demographic groups.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is a shame and a tragedy that America is the only \ndeveloped nation where women die from childbirth now more than they did \nin the recent past.\n  Despite technology and innovation, it is becoming more dangerous to \nhave a child, especially for women of color. Growing your family \nshouldn't mean putting your life on the line.\n  In the coming weeks, I will be introducing comprehensive legislation \nto start pushing these numbers down.\n  Another public health crisis that affects some groups more than \nothers is the issue of gun violence.\n  Last month, hundreds of thousands of young people and supporters came \nto Washington, D.C., to challenge Congress to act and save lives. \nMillions more marched in their own cities with the same message.\n  Like all public health issues, people of color, women, and rural \nAmericans are far more impacted by gun violence. In fact, it remains \nthe leading cause of death for African-American men from birth to 44.\n  We are also tragically seeing spikes in rural and veteran suicides by \nguns, another public health issue that this House has ignored.\n  Despite these calls for action and the cold, hard facts, this House \nhas yet to act to save lives.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, I just spoke extensively about many problems and \nchallenges facing the health of Americans, but I want to close by \nhighlighting some recent successes to end health disparities.\n  First, this February, this House passed my Action for Dental Health \nAct, a bill that will better target existing resources to more \neffectively deliver oral and dental healthcare to underserved \ncommunities and populations.\n  And finally, I want to praise the new leaders in the medical, \nresearch, and advocacy professions who are working to end these deeply \nentrenched disparities.\n  Next week, I will honor the National Minority Quality Forum's 40 \nUnder 40, young leaders in the healthcare field who are working to \nsupport and empower minority communities to live longer, healthier \nlives.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to challenge this House to follow the \nexample of these young people and come together to improve the health \nof all Americans, especially those who have been forgotten for far too \nlong.\n"], "Mr. OLSEN": ["2018-04-24", "  Mr. OLSEN.
